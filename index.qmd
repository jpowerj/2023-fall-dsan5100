This is a "hub" collecting relevant links for each week, for students in Prof. Jeff's **Thursday section (Section 03)** of *DSAN 5100: Probabilistic Modeling and Statistical Computing*, Fall 2023 at Georgetown University. Sections take place in **Car Barn room 201** on **Thursdays** from **12:30pm to 3:30pm**.

This page is *not* a replacement for the **<a href="https://jfh.georgetown.domains/dsan5100/" target="_blank">Main Course Page</a>** or the course's **<a href="https://georgetown.instructure.com/courses/173333" target="_blank">Canvas Page</a>**, which are shared across all sections!

Use the menu on the left, or the table below, to view the resources for a specific week.
