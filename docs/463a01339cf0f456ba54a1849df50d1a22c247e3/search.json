    "text": "Proposition \\(p\\): A true-false statement like “1 + 1 = 2” or “\\(x\\) is greater than 5”. The latter would be written as \\(p(x)\\), since its true/false value depends on a given value of \\(x\\).\n\\(\\wedge\\): Logical “and”. \\(p \\wedge q\\) is true only if both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true.\n\\(\\vee\\): Logical “or”. \\(p \\vee q\\) is true if \\(p\\) is true or \\(q\\) is true, or both are true.\n\\(\\neg\\): Logical negation: If \\(p\\) is true, \\(\\neg p\\) is false. If \\(p\\) is false, \\(\\neg p\\) is true.\nDeMorgan’s Laws: Logical identities which illustrate how the negation operator gets “distributed” in a logical statement, allowing conversion of “or” statements into “and” statements, and vice-versa: \\(\\neg(p \\wedge q) = \\neg(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q)\\)\n\\(\\implies\\): “Implies”. \\(a \\implies b\\) is true if, whenever \\(a\\) is true, \\(b\\) is also true.\n\\(\\iff\\): “If and only if”. \\(a \\iff b\\) is true if, \\(a\\) is only true when \\(b\\) is true, and \\(a\\) is only false when \\(b\\) is false.\n\\(\\exists\\): “There exists”. In the course this will be written as \\(\\exists x \\in S [p(x)]\\), which means that there exists some element \\(x\\) in the set \\(S\\) such that \\(p(x)\\) is true. Also called the “existential quantifier”.\n\\(\\forall\\): “For all”. In the course this will be written as \\(\\forall x \\in S [p(x)]\\), which means that for every element in a set \\(S\\) (with \\(x\\) representing some element arbitrarily taken from \\(S\\)), the proposition \\(p(x)\\) is true. Also called the “universal quantifier”.\n\nNote that the universal and existential quantifiers are closely related by a negation law (just like \\(\\wedge\\) and \\(\\vee\\) and their connection via DeMorgan’s Laws): \\(\\neg \\left( \\forall x \\in S[p(x)] \\right) \\iff \\exists x \\in S [\\neg p(x)]\\). The negation on the outside of the quantified proposition has moved inside of it, with the quantifier flipped.\nThe same holds true in reverse: \\(\\neg \\left( \\exists x \\in S [p(x)] \\right) \\iff \\forall x \\in S [\\neg p(x)]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA set \\(S\\) (denoted by a capital letter when possible) is a collection of elements (denoted by a lowercase letter when possible).\n\nFor example, if \\(S = \\{0,1,2,3\\}\\), then \\(0\\) is an element of \\(S\\).\n\n\\(a \\in S\\): The proposition that \\(a\\) is an element of the set \\(S\\).\n\nIf \\(S = \\{0,1,2,3\\}\\), then \\(2 \\in S\\) but \\(5 \\notin S\\).\n\n\\(A \\subseteq S\\): The proposition that \\(A\\) is a subset of the set \\(S\\).\n\nIf \\(S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\), then \\(\\{1,3\\} \\subseteq S\\) but \\(\\{1,4\\} \\not\\subseteq S\\). Note that sets are defined to be subsets of themselves, so that \\(S \\subseteq S\\).\n\n\\(A \\subset S\\): The proposition that \\(A\\) is a proper subset of \\(S\\), meaning that \\(A \\subseteq S\\) but \\(A \\neq S\\).\n\nWhile sets are subsets of themselves, sets are not proper subsets of themselves, so that if \\(S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\), then \\(\\{1,2,3\\} \\subset S\\) but \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} \\not\\subset S\\).\n\n\\(|S|\\): The cardinality of, or number of elements in, a set \\(S\\).\n\nIf \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\), \\(|S| = 3\\).\nIf the set \\(S\\) has infinite cardinality, we can distinguish between two cases:\n\nIf elements of \\(S\\) can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), we say that \\(S\\) is countably infinite and has cardinality \\(\\aleph_0\\) (pronounced “aleph-null”): \\(|S| = \\aleph_0\\).\nIf elements of \\(S\\) cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), we say that \\(S\\) is uncountably infinite and has cardinality greater than \\(\\aleph_0\\): \\(|S| &gt; \\aleph_0\\).\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(S)\\): The power set of a set \\(S\\), which is the set of all possible subsets of \\(S\\).\n\nFor example, if \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\), \\(\\mathcal{P}(S) = \\{\\varnothing, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{1,2,3\\}\\}\\). Notice that \\(|\\mathcal{P}(S)| = 2^{|S|}\\), which is always true of the power set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbb{N}\\): The set of all natural numbers, sometimes called the “counting numbers”: \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\}\\) (This set is countably infinite).\n\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\): The set of all integers, which includes all of the natural numbers along with their negatives: \\(\\{\\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}\\) (This set is also countably infinite)\n\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\): The set of all rational numbers, i.e., well-defined ratios of two integers. \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\iff x = \\frac{p}{q}\\) for two integers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), and \\(q \\neq 0\\). (This set is, surprisingly, also countably infinite)\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\): The set of all real numbers, which includes all integers as well as numbers such as \\(\\pi\\), \\(2.356\\), or \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) (This set is uncountably infinite).\nScalar: A single number from some set of numbers, like \\(-2.1 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\)\nVector: A \\(d\\)-dimensional vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a collection of \\(d\\) scalars in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_d)^\\top\\), which we can interpret as an arrow pointing \\(v_i\\) units in each dimension \\(i\\). For example, if \\(\\mathbf{v} = (3,5)\\), we can interpret \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) as representing an arrow pointing \\(3\\) units in the \\(x\\) direction and \\(5\\) units in the \\(y\\) direction.\n\nAs indicated above, however, we will assume that vectors are column vectors unless otherwise specified, though they will be written row-wise with a transpose symbol at the end. This means that, although it will be written like \\(\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n)^\\top\\), you should apply the transpose in your head: \\[\n\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n)^\\top = \\begin{bmatrix}v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nMatrix: An \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}_{[m \\times n]}\\) is an \\(m\\)-by-\\(n\\) grid of scalars, where the scalar in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column is denoted \\(m_{i,j}\\). In the class, we will be careful to add a subscript like \\(\\mathbf{M}_{[m \\times n]}\\) to indicate the number of rows (\\(m\\)) and columns (\\(n\\)) in the matrix, since operations like multiplication are only defined for matrices with particular dimensions.\nMatrix multiplication: For two matrices \\(\\mathbf{X}_{[a \\times b]}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{[c \\times d]}\\), matrix multiplication is defined if \\(b = c\\), and produces the following \\(a \\times d\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{XY}_{[a \\times d]}\\):\n\\[\n  \\mathbf{XY}_{[a \\times d]} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  x_{1,1}y_{1,1} & \\cdots & x_{m,1}y_{1,n} \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  x_{1,n}y_{m,1} & \\cdots & x_{m,n}y_{m,n}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n f(i)\\): \\(\\Sigma\\) is the capitalized Greek letter “Sigma”, and stands for “Sum” in this case. This notation means: “the sum of \\(f(i)\\) from \\(i = 1\\) to \\(i = n\\)”. For example, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^3 i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14\\).\n\\(\\prod_{i=1}^n f(i)\\): \\(\\Pi\\) is the capitalized Greek letter “Pi”, and stands for “Product” in this case. This notation means: “the product of \\(f(i)\\) from \\(i = 1\\) to \\(i = n\\)”. For example, \\(\\prod_{i=1}^3 i^2 = 1^2 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 36\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\\([a,b] \\in \\mathbb{R}\\): The closed interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) containing all numbers between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), including \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) themselves.\n\\((a,b) \\in \\mathbb{R}\\): The open interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) containing all numbers between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), excluding \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) themselves.\n\\([a, b)\\), \\((a, b]\\): The half-open interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In the first case, we include \\(a\\) but exclude \\(b\\), while in the second we exclude \\(a\\) but include \\(b\\).\n\\(\\int_{a}^b f(x)dx\\): The integral of the function \\(f(x)\\) between points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In this course, you just need to remember that this produces the area under the curve of \\(f(x)\\) between these points.\n\\(\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ f(x) \\right]\\): The derivative of the function \\(f(x)\\). For this class, you just need to remember that the derivative is what transforms a Cumulative Density Function (CDF) into a Probability Density Function (PDF): if \\(F_X(v)\\) is the CDF of a random variable \\(X\\), then \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[ F_X(v) \\right] = f_X(v)\\), the PDF of \\(X\\).\n\nFor functions of multiple variables, like the joint pdf \\(f_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\), we use the \\(\\partial\\) symbol instead of \\(d\\) to denote partial derivatives: for example, the change in \\(F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\) as \\(v_X\\) changes is denoted \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_X}\\left[ F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y) \\right]\\), while the change in \\(F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\) as \\(v_Y\\) changes is denoted \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_Y}\\left[ F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y) \\right]\\)."

    "text": "Deeper Dive\nBut now let’s think about what’s behind this… It’s a dangerous, highly contagious disease, meaning that (societally) false negatives are much, much worse than false positives:\n\nA false negative, in this case, means that someone is walking around thinking they don’t have the disease (because they tested negative), when they actually do. This means that they are not quarantining, they are going out to parties and events and etc., spreading the disease.\nA false positive, on the other hand, means someone who panics unnecessarily: maybe it means, they go to the hospital, the hospital performs additional tests, and successfully discovers that the person, despite their positive test result, doesn’t have the disease.\nSo, consequence-wise, a false negative potentially means a new outbreak of the disease in the society, while a false positive means a quick (scary, but hopefully quick) trip to the hospital\n\n\nThe Catastrophic Case\nSo, let’s focus on the disastrous first case: what’s the probability of a false negative? First, we can compute the conditional probability of a negative test, conditional on someone having the disease? Here we just use our complement rule of probability: that \\(\\Pr(E^c) = 1 - \\Pr(E)\\) for any event \\(E\\):\n\\[\n\\Pr(T = 0 \\mid D = 1) = 1 - \\Pr(T = 1 \\mid D = 1) = 0.01\n\\]\nNow that we know this, let’s incorporate the base rate information—that is, the information we have about the likelihood of having the disease (the thing we conditioned on above):\n\\[\n\\Pr(D = 1) = \\frac{1}{10000}\n\\]\nSo, given these two pieces of information, we can compute the probability of a person in the population being a false negative case: having the disease, but not being detected by the test.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(T = 0 \\cap D = 1) &= \\Pr(T = 0 \\mid D = 1)\\Pr(D = 1) \\\\\n&= (0.01)(1/10000) = \\frac{1}{1000000},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\ni.e., one in a million.\n\n\nThe Bad (But Not Catastrophic) Case\nNow let’s turn to the second, bad but not catastrophic, case: the probability of a false positive. As before, we start by computing the conditional probability of a positive test result for someone who in fact does not have the disease:\n\\[\n\\Pr(T = 1 \\mid D = 0) = 1 - \\Pr(T = 0 \\mid D = 0) = 0.01\n\\]\nThis time, however, we’ll see that the base rate will make a big difference. The base rate in this case—the probability of someone not having the disease—is:\n\\[\n\\Pr(D = 0) = 1 - \\Pr(D = 1) = \\frac{9999}{10000}\n\\]\nSo, incorporating these two pieces of information, we can compute the likelihood of a false positive case: someone in the population who doesn’t have the disease but does test positive:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(T = 1 \\cap D = 0) &= \\Pr(T = 1 \\mid D = 0)\\Pr(D = 0) \\\\\n&= (0.01)(9999/10000) = \\frac{9999}{1000000}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIn words: for every million people in the population, 9999 of them will have a false positive panic: they won’t have the disease, but they will think they have the disease because of their positive test."

    "text": "Approach 2: Using R Like a Fancy Calculator\nIn this approach, we basically just use R (or Python, or whatever else) as a glorified calculator. We take the hard part—reasoning about what the sample space might look like, for example, or whether events are independent—and do it in our heads, then use R to figure out what happens when we multiply/add/divide the things we already figured out.\nContinuing the dice example, for instance, this approach would go something like: we ask you\n\nWhat is the probability that you observe a roll greater than 4, followed by a roll less than or equal to 4, followed by a roll greater than 4?\n\nand you reason through this like,\n\nI already know that there are 6 outcomes, and that they’re all equally likely, so that the probability of seeing a particular outcome in \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) is always \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). Therefore I can define an event \\(E_&gt;\\) representing the event of observing an outcome greater than 4, and another event \\(E_\\leq\\) of observing an outcome less than or equal to 4. I know that\n\n\n\nSince the possible outcomes greater than 4 are 5 and 6, my event \\(E_&gt; = \\{5, 6\\}\\), and since \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), I can compute the probability of \\(E_&gt;\\) as \\[\n\\Pr(E_&gt;) = \\frac{|E_&gt;|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{|\\{5, 6\\}|}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSince the possible outcomes less than or equal to 4 are 1, 2, 3, and 4, my event \\(E_\\leq = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\), so I can compute the probability of \\(E_\\leq\\) as \\[\n\\Pr(E_\\leq) = \\frac{|E_\\leq|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{|\\{1, 2, 3, 4|}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAnd now I can use R with these probabilities I computed in my head to derive the probabilities of them occurring in a particular sequence:\n\n\n# Encode probabilities of my two events\np_greater &lt;- 1/3\np_less_or_equal &lt;- 2/3\n# Use them to compute the probabilities of sequences\np_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\np_sequence\n\n[1] 0.07407407\n\n\nThis approach may seem boring at first, since again we could have done this just on a calculator, but it becomes interesting when we ask you to vary the numbers to see what happens to the resulting probabilities.\nFor example, if you wrote the above code for some problem, then in the next problem we could say “It turns out the person providing you with the dice was cheating! They rigged it so that there’s actually a 99% chance of getting a number greater than 4! Go back and compute the probability of this sequence but using the rigged die”\nAnd then you could just change the first line of your code, and re-run the whole thing, to obtain the new probability:\n\np_greater &lt;- 0.99\np_less_or_equal &lt;- 0.01\np_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\np_sequence\n\n[1] 0.009801\n\n\nFinally, we might then ask you something like:\n“Your friend actually invented a machine that can generated any rigged die at all, so that the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 is whatever they want it to be.\nYou are worried because you always play a game with this friend where you win if you roll something greater than 4, then less than or equal to 4, then greater than 4. So you want to see how the friend’s rigging machine could affect your likelihood of winning.\nWrite a function that computes your likelihood of winning (i.e., your likelihood of getting this sequence of three rolls), for any die with any probability of producing an outcome greater than 4.\nIn this case, you could now take your code and transform it into a function, like\n\ncompute_win_prob &lt;- function(p_greater) {\n    p_less_or_equal &lt;- 1 - p_greater\n    p_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\n    return(p_sequence)\n}\n\nAnd then test it on some values:\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.01)\n\n[1] 9.9e-05\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.5)\n\n[1] 0.125\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.99)\n\n[1] 0.009801\n\n\nThen we could ask you to think about\nWhat value for p_greater do you think would maximize your probability of winning?\nand then\nProduce a plot showing your likelihood of winning for 1000 different values of p_greater, evenly spread between 0 and 1\nand you could use the function you wrote like\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\np_greater_vals &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000)\n#p_greater_vals\nwin_prob_vals &lt;- sapply(p_greater_vals, compute_win_prob)\nwin_df &lt;- tibble(p_greater=p_greater_vals, win_prob=win_prob_vals)\nggplot(win_df, aes(x=p_greater, y=win_prob)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  dsan_theme(\"full\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Probability of Winning With Rigged Die\",\n    x = \"Pr(Result &gt; 4)\",\n    y = \"Pr(Win)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, we could ask you to draw a conclusion about this situation:\nLooking at the plot, approximately what value for the rigged die looks like it produces the maximum likelihood of winning? Now write code to compute the actual value, out of the 1000 evenly-spaced values you computed the win probability for, that maximizes your probability of winning. Does it match your guess from earlier?\nFor which you could write code like\n\nmax_prob &lt;- max(win_df$win_prob)\nmax_row &lt;- win_df %&gt;% filter(win_prob == max_prob)\nmax_row\n\n\n\n\n\np_greater\nwin_prob\n\n\n\n\n0.6666667\n0.1481481\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy point in writing all this out is just to say: that was a whole other way to compute probabilities using a computer, where the focus wasn’t on making a big tibble and then extracting smaller chunks out of it and dividing their sizes. We did have to construct a tibble, in order to compute the win probabilities for a spectrum of values, but that was just so we could generate a plot (since ggplot() needed to know specifically what points to put at what coordinates).\nSo, in this approach, we don’t have a single tibble throughout the entire problem that serves as our sample space. We just use tibbles when we need them, as tools for doing math or making plots, while the probabilities themselves are still getting computed using simple multiplication.\nAnd, I mentioned above how the tibble-subsetting method doesn’t allow us to deal with continuous probability distributions. We’ve now seen, on the other hand, how this “fancy calculator” approach is able to deal with such distributions: we were really looking at the distribution of all possible rigged dice, meaning, the space of all dice with \\(\\Pr(\\text{roll greater than 4}) = p\\) for \\(p \\in [0,1]\\). We had to approximate this continuous space using a grid of 1000 samples, which brought us closer to the fancy-spreadsheet approach, but hopefully this can help make it a bit clearer how the fancy-calculator approach can help us when the fancy-spreadsheet approach can’t, even if it (the fancy-calculator approach) requires us to do a lot more math in our heads."

    "section": "The Drunkard’s Walk",
    "text": "The Drunkard’s Walk\nIn class today I described one of the many Data Generating Processes that could give rise to normally-distributed data. It involved a simple random walk, where you imagine a person on a numberline at the point \\(x = 0\\), and then imagine them flipping a coin repeatedly: when the coin comes up Tails, they move 1 unit to the left, and when the coin comes up Heads they move 1 unit to the right. This stochastic process can be visualized via the following diagram[^drunkard]:\n\nHere we can think of the “layers” (the vertical columns) in the diagram as representing the branching possibilities in each step: at time \\(t = 0\\), before any coin flips have been carried out, there is only one possible state of the system: the person is at the point \\(x = 0\\).\nAfter a single time step, at time \\(t = 1\\), there are now two possible states of the system: if the (single) coin flip came up Tails the person is at \\(x = -1\\), and if it came up Heads the person is at \\(x = 1\\).\nHopefully some general aspects and mathematical properties of this stochastic process immediately stand out:\n\nThere are two ways we could describe a given state of this system at a time \\(t\\):\n\nFirst, we could describe the history of all choices that led to the current state: the node at the top of the \\(t = 2\\) column, for example, could be represented as a vector \\((L, L)\\), corresponding to the fact that the person ended up at this state by moving left, then moving left again.\nAlternatively, we could choose to only keep track of the person’s position on the number line, dropping the information about their history (how they got there). If we choose this option, the state can be described by a single number: the \\(x\\) coordinate of where the person is located at that time.\nNotice how this second option “collapses” some of the nodes in the diagram down into a single state: for example, the three history vectors \\(()\\) (the vector corresponding to the start node, where no moves have been made yet), \\((L,R)\\) and \\((R,L)\\), which are three different states under the first option, both represent the single state \\(x = 0\\) if we use this option.\n\nThe number of possible states (nodes) at each time step \\(t\\) is just \\(2^t\\). This comes from our multiplication rule from earlier in the semester: if we’re making \\(n\\) choices, where each choice involves choosing between \\(k\\) alternatives, the total number of choice vectors (decisions for all \\(n\\) choices) is \\(k^n\\). Here we’re making \\(t\\) choices (one at each time step), choosing between \\(2\\) alternatives each time (going left vs. going right), giving \\(2^t\\) total choice vectors.\n\nNow that we have an idea of some of the mathematical properties of this system, let’s focus in on converting this into code!\nFirst things first, we make sure to use R’s set.seed() function to ensure reproducibility of our results across different runs of the notebook:\nset.seed(5100)\nYour first intuition might be to create a variable x to keep track of the state, then create a loop that will run N times, updating the state each time through the loop. In data science world, it turns out that this approach is very inefficient (in terms of memory usage but also, more importantly, in terms of the time it will take to run the simulation). But, let’s start with that and work our way towards the more efficient solution.\nFor concreteness, let’s try to simulate a person following this procedure for N = 10 steps, where each coin flip is with a fair coin, with \\(\\Pr(H) = 0.5\\). I am forever infinitely mad about the fact that R does not come with built-in support for the Bernoulli distribution (literally the distribution that every single other possible discrete distribution is built on top of…), so instead of using dbinom() incorrectly like I did in class, I am instead going to import the Rlab library, which adds in functions like dbern(), rbern(), etc., that are bafflingly absent from base-R:\n\nlibrary(Rlab)\nt &lt;- 0\nx &lt;- 0\nwriteLines(paste0(\"Starting state (t = \",t,\"): x = \",x))\nfor (i in seq(from = 1, to = 10)) {\n    writeLines(paste0(\"=====[ Step \",i,\" ]=====\"))\n    # Flip coin\n    flip_outcome &lt;- rbern(1,0.5)\n    writeLines(paste0(\"Coin flip outcome: \",flip_outcome))\n    # Choose direction based on result\n    direction &lt;- \"\"\n    if (flip_outcome == 0) {\n        # Outcome = Tails\n        direction &lt;- \"Left\"\n        x &lt;- x - 1\n    } else {\n        # Outcome = Heads\n        direction &lt;- \"Right\"\n        x &lt;- x + 1\n    }\n    # And increment the time counter\n    t &lt;- t + 1\n    writeLines(paste0(\"Moved \",direction))\n    writeLines(paste0(\"New state (t = \",t,\"): x = \",x))\n}\n\n# # Unique id for each person\n# pid &lt;- seq(1, num_people)\n# pid_tib &lt;- tibble(pid)\n# pos_df &lt;- tibble()\n# end_df &lt;- tibble()\n#   all_steps &lt;- t(replicate(num_people, sample(support, num_steps, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))))\n\nRlab 4.0 attached.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'Rlab'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    dexp, dgamma, dweibull, pexp, pgamma, pweibull, qexp, qgamma,\n    qweibull, rexp, rgamma, rweibull\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:datasets':\n\n    precip\n\n\n\n\nStarting state (t = 0): x = 0\n=====[ Step 1 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 1\nMoved Right\nNew state (t = 1): x = 1\n=====[ Step 2 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 2): x = 0\n=====[ Step 3 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 3): x = -1\n=====[ Step 4 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 4): x = -2\n=====[ Step 5 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 1\nMoved Right\nNew state (t = 5): x = -1\n=====[ Step 6 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 6): x = -2\n=====[ Step 7 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 7): x = -3\n=====[ Step 8 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 8): x = -4\n=====[ Step 9 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 9): x = -5\n=====[ Step 10 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 1\nMoved Right\nNew state (t = 10): x = -4\n\n\nTechnically, this code is sufficient to carry out our whole simulation, if we didn’t care about memory/time considerations. For example, we could use it to write a slow_simulation function, that takes in num_steps as its argument, simulates this many steps of the process, and returns the resulting state. To avoid the function printing out all of the above information 100 times, which will make things run even more slowly, I will also add a verbose argument that is set to FALSE by default. This is good practice in some cases, software-engineering-wise, since if something goes wrong during a call to the function we can re-run the function with verbose set to be TRUE and see the same type of info we printed out above.\n\nslow_simulation &lt;- function(num_steps, verbose = FALSE) {\n    t &lt;- 0\n    x &lt;- 0\n    if (verbose) {\n        writeLines(paste0(\"Starting state (t = \",t,\"): x = \",x))\n    }\n    for (i in 1:num_steps) {\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"=====[ Step \",i,\" ]=====\"))\n        }\n        # Flip coin\n        flip_outcome &lt;- rbern(1,0.5)\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"Coin flip outcome: \",flip_outcome))\n        }\n        # Choose direction based on result\n        direction &lt;- \"\"\n        if (flip_outcome == 0) {\n            # Outcome = Tails\n            direction &lt;- \"Left\"\n            x &lt;- x - 1\n        } else {\n            # Outcome = Heads\n            direction &lt;- \"Right\"\n            x &lt;- x + 1\n        }\n        # And increment the time counter\n        t &lt;- t + 1\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"Moved \",direction))\n            writeLines(paste0(\"New state: x = \",x))\n        }\n    }\n    return(x)\n}\n\nIt is usually good practice, once you’ve written a function like this, to test that it works for the simplest “corner cases” or “base cases”: in this case, for example, we should quickly verify that it always produces the expected output \\(x = 0\\) when we ask it for the result of the process after zero steps:\n\nreplicate(10, slow_simulation(0))\n\n\n00-200-200-2-2\n\n\nAnd alas, we have already found a bug in our implementation! It turns out that, unlike in Python or most other programming languages, using just the colon operator (:) can lead to some terrifying bugs,since if the number after the : is less than the number before the :, R will just start iterating backwards from the first number down to the second number:\n\n5:-3\n\n\n543210-1-2-3\n\n\nThis may seem inocuous, until you try to write a function like this which loops a specific number of times, and you try to support the case of running zero times. For example, if you use 1:n, and you accept n as an argument to your function, you’ll get a case like the following:\n\nn &lt;- 0\n1:n\n\n\n10\n\n\nThe takeaway is: if we want to be fully careful, and we want to make sure our function also produces the correct answer for zero steps, then we need to use R’s seq_len() function! seq_len(N) can be used in a loop to ensure that R loops over a sequence from 1 to N, and always counts up, so we avoid this case:\n\nslow_simulation &lt;- function(num_steps, verbose = FALSE) {\n    t &lt;- 0\n    x &lt;- 0\n    if (verbose) {\n        writeLines(paste0(\"Starting state (t = \",t,\"): x = \",x))\n    }\n    for (i in seq_len(num_steps)) {\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"=====[ Step \",i,\" ]=====\"))\n        }\n        # Flip coin\n        flip_outcome &lt;- rbern(1,0.5)\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"Coin flip outcome: \",flip_outcome))\n        }\n        # Choose direction based on result\n        direction &lt;- \"\"\n        if (flip_outcome == 0) {\n            # Outcome = Tails\n            direction &lt;- \"Left\"\n            x &lt;- x - 1\n        } else {\n            # Outcome = Heads\n            direction &lt;- \"Right\"\n            x &lt;- x + 1\n        }\n        # And increment the time counter\n        t &lt;- t + 1\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"Moved \",direction))\n            writeLines(paste0(\"New state: x = \",x))\n        }\n    }\n    return(x)\n}\n\nRe-running our tests, to make sure it works as expected now even in the N = 0 case, we get:\n\nreplicate(10, slow_simulation(0))\n\n\n0000000000\n\n\nThere may still be issues, but now let’s use this function to find the state of the system after N = 100 steps (we’ll run it 3 times here, just to show how it can produces different outcomes each time it is re-run)\n\nslow_simulation(100)\n\n6\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(100)\n\n-20\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(100)\n\n-6\n\n\nAnd we see that, repeating the process 4 times, the random-walker ended up at \\(x = -20\\), \\(x = 2\\), and \\(x = -2\\) after 100 steps. From this (or from intuition from the diagram, or from thinking about the process in general), we could infer another fact: that the random-walker will end up at an even-numbered coordinate if they take an even number of steps (including 0 steps). By similar reasoning, if we run the process for an odd number of steps, the random-walker will end up on an odd-numbered coordinate (here we run for a few even and odd values, so you can start to see this general pattern):\n\nslow_simulation(7)\n\n1\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(8)\n\n2\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(9)\n\n1\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(11)\n\n-1\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(13)\n\n1\n\n\nHere we have to pause, because we have to take into account the fact that we really want to simulate this process for a large number of people, and a large number of steps, so that this loop-based approach is going to become super slow and unwieldy as we increase the number of people/steps.\nSo, let’s think about how we could speed it up. Honestly, this can often be more of an art than a science, but it is genuinely so important, as it can mean the difference between your code finishing in a few seconds and finishing in a few hours.\nFor this problem, there are a number of ways you could arrive at a faster, more efficient approach, but for the sake of brevity I will cut to the chase and just mention that a key property we can use here is the fact that the outcome after N steps, regardless of how big N is, is really just a sum of independently-generated 0/1 variables!\nWe could derive this insight, for example, by recalling the above discussion about the two different ways to store the state of the system (storing just the value of \\(x\\) vs. storing the entire history), and thinking about the relationship between these two representations:\n\nIf we know the entire history of a random-walker, we could use that information to figure out their position, by just starting from \\(x = 0\\) and following each of the steps recorded in their history vector.\nThe converse isn’t true, though: if we know that the random-walker is at \\(x = 0\\), we cannot infer (at least, cannot infer with certainty) the history of states that led them to end up at that coordinate. As we already saw just in considering two time steps, for example, they could have arrived at \\(x = 0\\) via the histories \\(()\\), \\((L,R)\\), or \\((R,L)\\).\n\nThis insight becomes especially helpful if we think about how we could encode what we’re currently writing as \\(R\\) or \\(L\\) in a more helpful way: leaping once again over lots of thinking about it, if we chose to instead encode a move left as the number \\(-1\\), and a move right as the number \\(1\\), suddenly we may be able to see the relationship between the full-history state space and the “collapsed” state space where we just keep track of \\(x\\). We can write out some histories using this \\(-1\\) or \\(1\\) representation, then look at the \\(x\\) value these histories produce, and try to see the pattern:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory vector(original)\nHistory vector(numeric representation)\nResulting values of \\(x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(()\\)\n\\(()\\)\n\\(x = 0\\)\n\n\n\\((L,L,R)\\)\n\\((-1, -1, 1)\\)\n\\(x = -1\\)\n\n\n\\((L,R)\\)\n\\((-1,1)\\)\n\\(x = 0\\)\n\n\n\\((R,R,R,R)\\)\n\\((1,1,1,1)\\)\n\\(x = 4\\)\n\n\n\\((R,L,R,L,R,L)\\)\n\\((1,-1,1,-1,1,-1)\\)\n\\(x = 0\\)\n\n\n\nDo you see the pattern? Jumping to the punchline: by using the numeric representation of the history vector, we can immediately derive the final position of the random-walker by summing up the values of their history vector in this representation!\nIf it’s still unclear why this is helpful, that’s ok: it may be an appreciation that only comes from spending hours debugging hundreds of tiny little errors in C code that your professor/boss has asked you to optimize down to the individual-bits-of-RAM level 😛 But it will hopefully become a little more clear regardless once we compare the runtimes of our two approaches!\nLet’s use this sum-to-get-final-state insight to rewrite our code without any loops. The main thing left to figure out is: how to generate a sequence of random values drawn uniformly from \\(\\{-1, 1\\}\\)? We could approach this using the discrete uniform distribution, or we could approach this by transforming the Bernoulli distribution (which produces values in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)) in a smart way. But, optimizing for laziness, we can do even less work: there is already a name for this distribution (of a random variable \\(X\\) with equally-likely outcomes drawn from the support set \\(\\mathcal{R}_X = \\{-1,1\\}\\)): it’s called the Rademacher Distribution.\nAs with the Bernoulli distribution, base-R does not have a built-in function for generating random Rademacher-distributed variables, so instead we can use an implementation provided by the extraDistr library, a function named rsign() (since you can think about this distribution as determining a random sign: positive or negative). Let’s use rsign() to rewrite our function so it just\n\nGenerates num_steps random numbers, each one representing a piece of the history vector, and then\nSums them to get our resulting \\(x\\) value\n\n\n# (Uncomment and run the following line if you\n# don't have the extraDistr library installed)\n#install.packages(\"extraDistr\")\n\n\nlibrary(extraDistr)\nfaster_simulation &lt;- function(num_steps, verbose = FALSE) {\n    # Generate a history vector with length `num_steps`,\n    # in the representation where every step is a coin\n    # flip, but we record -1 for tails and 1 for heads\n    history_vec &lt;- rsign(num_steps)\n    final_x &lt;- sum(history_vec)\n    return(final_x)\n}\n\n\nAttaching package: 'extraDistr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:Rlab':\n\n    dbern, pbern, qbern, rbern\n\n\n\n\nAnd now let’s check that it works for the corner case we identified above:\n\nreplicate(10,faster_simulation(0))\n\n\n0000000000\n\n\nAnd check that the values it generates still seem right, for non-corner-case values:\n\nfaster_simulation(100)\n\n2\n\n\n\nfaster_simulation(100)\n\n20\n\n\n\nfaster_simulation(100)\n\n12"

There are a few ways to measure the time that it takes for R functions to run, but to me the easiest way (and you want it to be easy when you’re spending hours and hours just trying to tweak the runtime of one function) is to use the tictoc library (not part of base-R): once you load this library using library(tictoc), you literally just put tic() somewhere in your code, then toc() somewhere afterwards, and it measures the time that elapsed in between these two function calls:\n\n# (Uncomment to install, if needed)\n#install.packages(\"tictoc\")\n\n\nlibrary(tictoc)\ntic()\n1 + 1\ntoc()\n\n2\n\n\n0.001 sec elapsed\n\n\nSo, let’s use this library to measure how long it takes the two approaches to simulate 1 million steps of the process (for one person):\n\nsteps_to_simulate &lt;- 1000000\n\n\n# Our first attempt\ntic()\nslow_simulation(steps_to_simulate)\nslow_sim_times &lt;- toc()\nslow_sim_elapsed &lt;- as.numeric(slow_sim_times$toc - slow_sim_times$tic)\nslow_sim_elapsed\n\n2150\n\n\n1.603 sec elapsed\n\n\n1.603\n\n\n\ntic()\nfaster_simulation(steps_to_simulate)\nfast_sim_times &lt;- toc()\nfast_sim_elapsed &lt;- as.numeric(fast_sim_times$toc - fast_sim_times$tic)\nfast_sim_elapsed\n\n-98\n\n\n0.008 sec elapsed\n\n\n0.00800000000000001\n\n\nBy dividing the elapsed times for the two approaches (which we’ll be able to interpret since these are ratio variables 😉):\n\nelapsed_ratio &lt;- slow_sim_elapsed / fast_sim_elapsed\nelapsed_ratio\n\n200.375\n\n\nWe can see that, already (just for one person), the improved version using sum() runs 128 times faster than our original approach using a for loop 😳\nWe could optimize the move to multiple people even more, but even if we just keep the two implementations as they currently are, and use replicate() to repeat them 10 times (i.e., generate history vectors and results for 10 people instead of 1), the efficiency difference becomes even more pronounced:\n\nnum_people &lt;- 10\n\n\n# Our first attempt, now for 10 people\ntic()\nreplicate(num_people, slow_simulation(steps_to_simulate))\nslow_sim_times &lt;- toc()\nslow_sim_elapsed &lt;- as.numeric(slow_sim_times$toc - slow_sim_times$tic)\nslow_sim_elapsed\n\n\n-220482-1626-308390952-1410-14781180-548\n\n\n15.27 sec elapsed\n\n\n15.27\n\n\n\ntic()\nreplicate(num_people, faster_simulation(steps_to_simulate))\nfast_sim_times &lt;- toc()\nfast_sim_elapsed &lt;- as.numeric(fast_sim_times$toc - fast_sim_times$tic)\nfast_sim_elapsed\n\n\n-3789121174-688-1264360-2514-298-3421208\n\n\n0.077 sec elapsed\n\n\n0.0769999999999982\n\n\nWe now, in both cases, have simulated data for 10 people performing this random walk procedure, both equally valid in terms of our use to simulate [one of] the data-generating process[es] underlying the Normal Distribution. But the original approach takes about 15 seconds to generate this simulated data, while the second approach takes less than 1/10th of 1 second to generate the same amount of data… 🤯\nThis represents a speedup of\n\nslow_sim_elapsed / fast_sim_elapsed\n\n198.311688311693\n\n\ni.e., about a 20,000% speed boost…\nSo, if this efficiency gap has convinced you1, we can now drop the first approach and just use the faster version to start digging into the Normal Distribution!"

It’s our old friend the “bell curve”! We can see from the plot that the mean of this simulated data is probably something very close to 0, but the standard deviation is harder to figure out just from looking at the picture, so let’s compute these directly from the data:\n\nmu &lt;- mean(x_tibble$x_T)\nmu\n\n0.0840000000000668\n\n\n\nsigma &lt;- sd(x_tibble$x_T)\nsigma\n\n31.6289283392758\n\n\nSo the overall mean \\(\\mu\\) of the final positions of all 1 million people is about 0.084, while the overall standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is about 31.629. The mean has an intuitive interpretation, but we need to use the 68-95-99.7 Rule to interpret the standard deviation as follows:\n\nApproximately 68% of the data lies within the range \\([\\mu - 1\\cdot \\sigma, \\mu + 1 \\cdot \\sigma]\\), which in our case is\n\n\nc(mu - sigma, mu + sigma)\n\n\n-31.544928339275731.7129283392759\n\n\n\nApproximately 95% of the data lies within the range \\([\\mu - 2\\cdot \\sigma, \\; \\mu + 2 \\cdot \\sigma]\\), which in our case is\n\n\nc(mu - 2 * sigma, mu + 2 * sigma)\n\n\n-63.173856678551563.3418566785516\n\n\n\nApproximately 99.7% of the data lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean, that is, within the range \\([\\mu - 3 \\cdot \\sigma, \\; \\mu + 3 \\cdot \\sigma]\\), which in our case is\n\n\nc(mu - 3 * sigma, mu + 3 * sigma)\n\n\n-94.802785017827394.9707850178274\n\n\nRoughly, then, we can interpret this last fact as saying that nearly all (99.7%) of the random walkers will still remain within 100 units of their starting position, after 1000 steps."

    "text": "Applying Transformations to x_T\nIt may have seemed like overkill to take the length-1000000 vector we had and convert it into a 1000000-row tibble, since we only had one column. But now let’s see why we did this: let’s take this column of the raw (simulated) values of \\(x_T\\) and use it to derive simulated values of functions of \\(x_T\\).\nFor example, instead of analyzing the positions, perhaps in the context of our problem we only care about how far away the people end up from their starting point. In that case, what we really care about is not \\(x\\) itself but \\(|x - 0| = |x|\\), the absolute distance (on the numberline) of the person’s final position from their starting position.\nNow that you’ve seen how changing from a for-loop-based approach to a “vectorized” approach can vastly improve efficiency, I also want you to move your focus away from how these absolute distances could be computed using a loop and instead focus on how they could be computed using a mathematical function that could be applied to an entire vector of data (in this case, the vector that we get by pulling the x_T column out of the tibble). In this case hopefully this mathematical operation is clear: we just want to apply the absolute value function to the x_T column vector. So, here let’s use the mutate() function from dplyr (part of the tidyverse) to create a new column in our tibble called abs_dist, computed on the basis of x_T and representing this absolute distance:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nx_tibble &lt;- x_tibble |&gt; mutate(abs_dist = abs(x_T))\nx_tibble |&gt; head()\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:Rlab':\n\n    count\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\n\n\n\nA tibble: 6 x 3\n\n\nobs_id\nx_T\nabs_dist\n\n\n&lt;int&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n1\n54\n54\n\n\n2\n22\n22\n\n\n3\n-8\n8\n\n\n4\n40\n40\n\n\n5\n-4\n4\n\n\n6\n-18\n18\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we see that, at least in the first six columns, our “pipeline” has successfully taken the absolute values of the x_T column: -42 has been transformed to 42, -70 to 70, and so on.\nNow, just as we did above, we can plot the distribution of this data, which is not the “raw” (simulated) data but a function of the raw data, which forms its own distribution that may be different from the distribution of the original data:\n\nggplot(x_tibble, aes(x = abs_dist)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=6) +\n  dsan_theme()\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve plotted two distributions using the geom_histogram() function from the ggplot2 library, it’s probably a good time to also mention how (like the warning messages from ggplot2 will try to warn you) histograms can sometimes be more misleading than helpful when it comes to understanding your data: skipping over lots of details2, the way that the hisogram looks depends a good amount on the bin width or number of bins parameter, so that (a) it’s good to examine the histogram of the distribution under many different choices for this bin width/number of bins, but also (b) it’s good to check what the kernel density plot of the distribution looks like, as an alternative to the histogram:\n\nggplot(x_tibble, aes(x = abs_dist)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  dsan_theme()\n\n\n\n\nThe kernel density plot’s bandwidth parameter can be tweaked to make the plot look different, just like the binwidth parameter of geom_histogram() can be tweaked to make the histogram look different, but in my experience geom_density() tends to require less tweaking: it usually produces the distribution that I’m expecting to see (if I already know what the distribution should look like), so that I trust it a bit more to give a reasonably accurate “picture” of the distribution of data that I haven’t seen before.\nThis distribution, just like the Normal and Rademacher distributions we’ve seen so far, has a name! It is called the Folded Normal Distribution, if you’d like to learn how that works."

    "text": "Row-Wise Operations in tidyverse\nIn terms of what you have to do to complete Lab 4, this is probably the most important thing to know about tidyverse functions, especially those in dplyr: they are not as easy to use row-wise as the base-R functions are!\nWe just saw how “naturally” the tidyverse functions allow us to compute new columns by applying a unary transformation (like abs() or ^2) to one previously-existing column. But, if you want to compute a new column by applying an arbitrary function to two or more columns of your tibble at a time, you have to use the tidyverse construct rowwise(), and (frustratingly) not all transformation functions work well with this rowwise() operator.\nTo see what I mean, let’s go back to our simulation function from above and generate another column x2_T, containing the results from running the random walk 1000 steps for 1 million simulated people again:\n\nx2_T_vals &lt;- replicate(N, faster_simulation(T))\nx_tibble &lt;- x_tibble %&gt;% mutate(x2_T = x2_T_vals)\nx_tibble |&gt; head()\n\n\nA tibble: 6 x 5\n\n\nobs_id\nx_T\nabs_dist\nsq_dist\nx2_T\n\n\n&lt;int&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n1\n54\n54\n2916\n-10\n\n\n2\n22\n22\n484\n-2\n\n\n3\n-8\n8\n64\n52\n\n\n4\n40\n40\n1600\n62\n\n\n5\n-4\n4\n16\n-14\n\n\n6\n-18\n18\n324\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now let’s assume we are interested in the maximum of these two values for a given person: intuitively, we might think we could just write max(x_T, x2_T) and it should work out, but let’s see what happens when we try this using tidyverse functions:\n\nx_tibble &lt;- x_tibble |&gt; mutate(x_max = max(x_T, x2_T))\nx_tibble |&gt; head()\n\n\nA tibble: 6 x 6\n\n\nobs_id\nx_T\nabs_dist\nsq_dist\nx2_T\nx_max\n\n\n&lt;int&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n1\n54\n54\n2916\n-10\n156\n\n\n2\n22\n22\n484\n-2\n156\n\n\n3\n-8\n8\n64\n52\n156\n\n\n4\n40\n40\n1600\n62\n156\n\n\n5\n-4\n4\n16\n-14\n156\n\n\n6\n-18\n18\n324\n6\n156\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething has gone horribly wrong, right? Every single value is the same, and this value doesn’t seem to correspond to any of the x2 values in the first six rows of the tibble.\nWhat happened is: R interpreted the expression max(x_T, x2_T) as saying “find the maximum value across both of these two vectors I’m giving you”, so it found that maximum value (156 in this case), and then the call to the mutate() function was interpreted in turn by tidyverse as you telling it to “create a new column called x_max and store the number 156 in it, in every slot”.\nTo further confirm what happened, we can actually go and find the row that led it to produce the number 156:\n\nx_tibble |&gt; filter((x_T == 156) | (x2_T == 156))\n\n\nA tibble: 1 x 6\n\n\nobs_id\nx_T\nabs_dist\nsq_dist\nx2_T\nx_max\n\n\n&lt;int&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n60249\n-30\n30\n900\n156\n156\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we see that participant number 60249 in our simulation indeed ended up at \\(x = -30\\) on their first run, but then at \\(x = 156\\) on their second run, the furthest to the right that anyone in the dataset ended up.\nTo properly compute the max of the values in a row (or some subset of the values, like we want in this case), we have to add the rowwise() transformation into our pipeline right before we use the mutate() function. This will then let the mutate() function know that, when we say max(), we mean the maximum over the specified values within each row, not across the entire dataset. So, redoing the above code with rowwise() added in looks like:\n\nx_tibble &lt;- x_tibble |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(x_max = max(x_T, x2_T))\nx_tibble |&gt; head()\n\n\nA rowwise_df: 6 x 6\n\n\nobs_id\nx_T\nabs_dist\nsq_dist\nx2_T\nx_max\n\n\n&lt;int&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n1\n54\n54\n2916\n-10\n54\n\n\n2\n22\n22\n484\n-2\n22\n\n\n3\n-8\n8\n64\n52\n52\n\n\n4\n40\n40\n1600\n62\n62\n\n\n5\n-4\n4\n16\n-14\n-4\n\n\n6\n-18\n18\n324\n6\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we can breathe a sigh of relief: the max() function used within mutate() has now been interpreted as we wanted: as a rowwise maximum, so that the value in the x_max column now represents that individual’s highest x_T value. And, we can take a look at the distribution of this maximum value, seeing whether (for example) it is still normal or whether it takes on the shape of some other known distribution:\n\nggplot(x_tibble, aes(x = x_max)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  dsan_theme()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd using the kernel density geometry instead:\n\nggplot(x_tibble, aes(x = x_max)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\nThis time, the data does look approximately normal. I will leave it to you all (just like on Lab 4) to interpret why this may be the case! (Or whether it’s the case at all…) But if you are stuck just let me know / come to my office hours, and I’m happy to help you think more about this max() transformation!"

That is, knowing that \\(p\\) is true does not tell us that \\(q\\) is true: if we know \\(p\\) (so we know that \\(x &gt; 3\\)), we still don’t know \\(q\\), since we could have e.g. \\(x = 4\\).\n\nIf \\(p\\) is sufficient for \\(q\\), then if we know \\(p\\) is true we also know that \\(q\\) is true.\n\nFor example, let \\(p = [x\\text{ is divisible by }4]\\) and \\(q = [x\\text{ is even}]\\)\nThen \\(p\\) is a sufficient condition for \\(q\\), since all numbers divisible by 4 are also even.\nAgain you have to be careful, because the converse does not hold: knowing that \\(q\\) is false in this example does not tell us that \\(p\\) is false: if we know \\(\\neg q\\), we know \\(x\\) is not divisible by 4, but \\(p\\) can still be true, since e.g. \\(x\\) could be 6 (an even number not divisible by 4).\n\n\nI think keeping this in mind is helpful for this specific problem, because we can think about the following two necessary conditions that must hold for a given function \\(f_Z(v)\\) to represent a valid pdf for the random variable \\(Z\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing from Single-Valued to Multi-Valued pdfs\n\n\n\nI use \\(Z\\) to define the pdf \\(f_Z(v)\\) here to emphasize how pdfs are (at their core) defined for single random variables like \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), or \\(Z\\).\nNonetheless, as we enter into multivariable probability world we can consider \\(f_Z(v)\\) as the pdf for a vector-valued random variable \\(Z\\), so that \\(Z\\) can in fact represent a point that is decomposable into an \\(x\\)-coordinate (represented by a random variable \\(X\\)) and a \\(y\\)-coordinate (represented by a random variable \\(Y\\)). In this case, we can rewrite \\(Z\\) as \\((X,Y)\\) and call our pdf \\(f_{(X,Y)}(v_X, x_Y)\\), which for succinctness we usually shorten to just \\(f_{X,Y}(x,y)\\)."

    "text": "Why Are You Telling Us All This? How Does It Help Solve Problem 1?\nIf you’ve made it all the way to this point, you may be frustrated that I still haven’t pointed exactly to how these two conditions help us solve Problem 1.\nSince I can’t give away the solution for that particular problem, here I will show the applicability of these two conditions to a similar problem, and then your job is to think about how the way I work through this problem can help you work through problem 1.\nThe example problem: Given two random variables \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{U}[0,1]\\) and \\(Y \\sim \\mathcal{U}[0,1]\\), consider the joint distribution of the vector-valued random variable \\(Z = (X,Y)\\), where the possible realizations of \\(Z\\) are restricted to only those values of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) such that they lie within a circle of radius \\(1\\) around the origin: that is, \\(X^2 + Y^2 &lt; 1\\). This means that we could create a plot which “fills in” the possible values of \\(Z\\) more and more as we sample more points, by generating values of \\(X\\) sampled from from \\(\\mathcal{U}[0,1]\\) and values of \\(Y\\) sampled from \\(\\mathcal{U}[0,1]\\), then placing the points on the plot if they are “admissible” (if they form a valid realization of \\(Z\\)) and throwing the points away otherwise:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nN &lt;- 2500\nx_vals &lt;- runif(N, -1, 1)\ny_vals &lt;- runif(N, -1, 1)\nsample_df &lt;- tibble(x=x_vals, y=y_vals)\nsample_df &lt;- sample_df |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    admissible = x^2 + y^2 &lt; 1\n  )\nsample_df |&gt; head()\n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny\nadmissible\n\n\n\n\n0.0853844\n0.4159406\nTRUE\n\n\n-0.4991692\n-0.6671818\nTRUE\n\n\n-0.5449181\n0.9697597\nFALSE\n\n\n-0.2142207\n-0.8855359\nTRUE\n\n\n0.8015973\n0.2324585\nTRUE\n\n\n-0.6283825\n-0.0055527\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that, given how admissible is defined, plotting only the points for which admissible == TRUE will mean that we are “filling out” the subset of all possible values in the square \\([-1,1] \\times [-1,1]\\) that satisfy our contstraint:\n\nadmissible_df &lt;- sample_df |&gt;\n  filter(admissible)\nggplot(admissible_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  # If you were wondering how to make it an actual perfect circle\n  coord_fixed()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we can finally use our two necessary conditions, albeit in reverse order:\n\nApplying Necessary Condition 2 (Simplified Version) To This Case:\nTo satisfy this condition, let’s literally just define a pdf \\(f_{X,Y}\\) that has some non-zero value \\(c\\) for points within the circle in the above plot, and has value \\(0\\) otherwise:\n\\[\nf_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\begin{cases}\nc &\\text{if }x^2 + y^2 &lt; 1, \\\\\n0 &\\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nSo far, we’ve satisfied Necessary Condition 1 (\\(NC_1\\)) for \\(f_{X,Y}\\) to be a valid pdf. Now if we can figure out how to also make this function satisfy Necessary Condition 2 (\\(NC_2\\)), we’ll know that we have a valid pdf for \\(Z = (X,Y)\\).\n\n\nApplying Necessary Condition 1 To This Case\nGiven that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are both defined (in a nicely-behaved way) over the range \\([-1,1]\\), the remaining condition \\(NC_1\\) is satisfied if the following equality holds:\n\\[\n\\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1}f_{X,Y}(x,y)dxdy = 1\n\\tag{1}\\]\nIf you calculate these two definite integrals (you could do it using fancy math, like variable substitution, or just using geometry, e.g. by thinking about what the integral would be given what you know about the areas of circles), you will find that this integral-filled equality reduces to the equality\n\\[\nc\\pi = 1\n\\]\nSo that, finally, we can solve for the value of \\(c\\) which now lets us “fill in this detail”: that if we choose \\(c = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\), so that\n\\[\nf_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{\\pi} &\\text{if }x^2 + y^2 &lt; 1, \\\\\n0 &\\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nthen we get a nice chain of realizations:\n\nThe equality Equation 1 holds, so\nWe have satisfied \\(NC_1\\), after already satisfying \\(NC_2\\) above, so\nWe have now satisfied both \\(NC_1\\) and \\(NC_2\\),\nThis means we have satisfied \\(B\\), so that finally\nWe have defined a valid pdf \\(f_{X,Y}(x,y)\\) (since \\(B\\) is a sufficient condition for valid pdfs).\n\nI hope that helps somewhat: I wrote things out in excruciating detail, using necessary and sufficient conditions and etc., to try and show how there is a general logic to these types of problems (or at least, a general logic for how we can use the information we’re given to construct a distribution which encodes this information)."

    "text": "Marginalization In Discrete World\nMarginalization provides an example of where, unlike the case for some topics in the course, having a good intuition for the discrete case will actually help us a ton even when considering the continuous case. So, let’s start out by thinking through a joint discrete distribution, and thinking about what a marginal distribution derived from this joint discrete distribution actually represents.\nConsider a case where we are the principal at a “senior high school” (in the US, this means a high school/secondary school that students attend for grades 10, 11, and 12), where each student is in some grade but also has an honor student status which is 1 if the student is an honor student and 0 otherwise. We can represent the discrete frequency distribution (not that it is not a probability distribution, since the numbers in each “bin” are not between 0 and 1) using the following raw frequency table:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n\n\n\nSo far, we can’t use this table for much of anything, since it doesn’t contain probabilities and we also don’t (yet) know the total number of students, so that we don’t know what proportions of all students fall into each bin.\nSo now let’s say someone asks us the probability that, if we randomly select a student from the school (at uniform), the randomly-selected student will be an honor student in 11th grade.\nBy thinking about what specifically they’re asking for here, we can see that they’re asking us a question about the joint distribution of \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) at the school: specifically, they’re asking us for \\(\\Pr(G = 11, H = 1)\\), a question we can answer if we know the joint distribution \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\).\nUsing our naïve definition of probability, we can compute this probability using the frequencies in the table as\n\\[\n\\Pr(G = 11, H = 1) = \\frac{\\#(G = 11, H = 1)}{\\#\\text{ Students Total}}\n\\]\nand, plugging in the values from the above table, we obtain the answer\n\\[\n\\Pr(G = 11, H = 1) = \\frac{4}{33} \\approx 0.121\n\\]\nFollowing the same logic for all remaining cells in the table, we can convert our frequency table into a probability table by normalizing the counts to be proportions of the total. But, let’s think about two different ways we could compute the total number of students, since we’ll need to think about these two ways later on:\n\nComputing Overall Total by Column (Honors-Status Totals)\nStarting from our original frequency table:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n\n\n\nWe could start computing the total number of students by summing columns, to obtain:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n\n\nTotal\n23\n10\n\n\n\nAnd then we could total these two numbers in the totals row to obtain the overall total:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n\n\n\nTotal\n23\n10\n33\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing Overall Total by Row (Grade)\nAs an alternative to starting our computation of the overall totals by summing columns, we could start by summing rows.\nStarting from our original frequency table:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n\n\n\nWe could first sum each row, to obtain:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n15\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n10\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n8\n\n\n\nAnd then we could total the three partial sums in the totals column to obtain the overall total:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n15\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n10\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n8\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\nBringing Both Methods Together\nNotice how we obtained the same overall total, the total number of students, regardless of which dimension we chose to sum over first. So, let’s make a complete frequency table, where we have not only the frequencies of each bin but also the row totals, column totals, and a cell in the bottom-right representing the overall total:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n15\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n10\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n8\n\n\nTotal\n23\n10\n33\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting Frequencies into Probabilities\nNow, before we think about the totals row/column, let’s use the overall total (33) to convert our counts into probabilities:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n\\(\\frac{10}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{5}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{15}{33}\\)\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n\\(\\frac{6}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{4}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{10}{33}\\)\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n\\(\\frac{7}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{8}{33}\\)\n\n\nTotal\n\\(\\frac{23}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{10}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{33}{33}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Than One Distribution Can Be Derived From This Table!\nNow that we see the normalized counts, we can see the different ways we can look at this table to obtain probability distributions:\n\nFirst, there’s the distribution we were originally thinking about: the entries in each non-total cell form a probabiltiy distribution called the joint distribution of \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), since each entry is between 0 and 1 and the entries sum to 1:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 10, H = 0)}_{10 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 10, H = 1)}_{5 / 33} + \\\\\n&\\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 11, H = 0)}_{6 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 11, H = 1)}_{4 / 33} + \\\\\n&\\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 12, H = 0)}_{7 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 12, H = 1)}_{1 / 33} = 1\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBut, we can also notice that the two entries in the totals row (excluding the overall total) form a probability distribution, called the marginal distribution of \\(H\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\underbrace{\\Pr(H = 0)}_{23 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(H = 1)}_{10 / 33} = 1\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd, the three entries in the totals column (excluding the overall total) form a probability distribution, called the marginal distribution of \\(G\\):\n\n\\[\n\\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 10)}_{15 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 11)}_{10 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 12)}_{8 / 33} = 1\n\\]\nLet’s consider in a little more detail how we used the joint distribution—the full set of entries in the original table—to derive two different marginal distributions:\nSumming the values in each column:\nWhen we summed up the values in each column, we were summing up all possible pdf values \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) where \\(v_H = 0\\) and then all possible pdf values \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) where \\(v_H = 1\\). This gave us two new counts (or probabilities, if used the probability table rather than the frequency table) representing the marginal distribution of \\(H\\), a distribution where the variable \\(G\\) no longer appeared!\nSumming the values in each row:\nWhen we instead summed the values in each row, we summed all possible pdf values \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) where \\(v_G = 10\\), then all possible pdf values \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) where \\(v_G = 11\\), and finally all possible pdf values \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) where \\(v_G = 12\\). This gave us three new counts/probabilities representing the marginal distribution of \\(G\\), a distribution where the variable \\(H\\) no longer appeared!"

    "text": "What’s Missing? Conditional Distributions\nSo far we’ve discussed the interrelationship between joint distributions and marginal distributions: the latter was obtained from the former by summing.\nHowever, there is one type of distribution that is mentioned on your Lab assignment that we haven’t seen yet. The conditional distribution is a bit different from the joint and marginal distributions, in the sense that the conditional distribution does not represent a sum across some dimension of the table but a slice of the table: that is, it represents the new distribution which “pops out” when we consider one particular row or one particular column of the table.\nHowever, just like how above we figured out the marginal distributions by summing over columns and summing over rows separately, and seeing what resulted, let’s explore what conditional distributions look like by slicing the table by column first, then slicing the table by row:\n\nComputing Conditional Distributions as Columns (Honors-Status Values)\nLet’s consider what the table would look like if we just selected a single column: for example, let’s select just the column of values for which \\(H = 1\\). Throwing away all of the other columns in the table, this would give us a one-column table that looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n5\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n4\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n1\n\n\nTotal\n10\n\n\n\nNow notice that, just like how we were able to convert our frequency table into a probability table representing joint probabilities by dividing each of these values by 33 (the overall total of students across all possible grades and honors-status values), now we can convert this slice of the full table into its own distribution by dividing each of these individual values in the \\(H = 1\\) column by the total number of students in the \\(H = 1\\) column:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n\\(\\frac{5}{10}\\)\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n\\(\\frac{4}{10}\\)\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{10}\\)\n\n\nTotal\n\\(\\frac{10}{10}\\)\n\n\n\nNotice how, unlike in the above two cases, we now have to interpret the numeric value of the probabilities in each cell differently:\n\nJoint and marginal distributions represented some count relative to the total number of students in the school, hence the denominator of all probabilities in either of these cases was 33\nConditional distributions, however, represent a count relative to the number of students within the category we are conditioning on: the denominator is now 10 in each case, since we’re considering the number of students represented by each cell within the column as a proportion of the total number of students across the entire column."

    "text": "Discrete World Summary\nSo, as long as we notice that conditional distributions are weird in the sense that they require us to renormalize all of our probabilities from our table of joint and marginal distributions, we now have the link between all three types of distributions that get talked about when working with multivariate probability distributions:\n\nA single joint distribution: The normalized counts in each cell of the full 2D table; in other words, the probability that a randomly-selected student from across the entire school will be in a particular bin (when students are binned by grade and honors status).\n\nFor example, the bin in the upper-left corner of our original table represents non-honors students in 10th grade (\\(G = 10, H = 0\\)).\n\nTwo marginal distributions: The normalized totals across each row, or across each column, of the full 2D table; in other words, the probability that a randomly-selected student from across the entire school will be in a particular aggregated bin.\n\nIf we aggregated by summing columns, for example, our first aggregated bin represents all non-honors students, students for whom \\(H = 0\\) (regardless of grade), and our second aggregated bin contains all honors students, students for whom \\(H = 1\\) (regardless of grade).\n\nSix possible conditional distributions: The re-normalized counts within a particular column or a particular row; in other words, the probability that a randomly-selected student from a particular category (the category we’re conditioning on) will be in one of the bins represented by individual slots within this row/column.\n\nIf we conditioned on the \\(H = 1\\) column, for example, then once we renormalize the counts in this column, the first entry represents the probability of a randomly-selected honors student being in grade 10: \\(\\Pr(G = 10 \\mid H = 1)\\)\n\n\nNotice, lastly, how we could use this intuition built from frequency tables to figure out how to go in opposite directions from the directions we derived things above: for example, if we were only given marginal distributions and conditional distributions, we could use this information to derive the full-on joint distribution table. Since we know the definition of conditional probability for example, that\n\\[\n\\Pr(B \\mid A) = \\frac{\\Pr(B, A)}{\\Pr(A)},\n\\]\nwe could re-arrange terms in this equality to obtain\n\\[\n\\Pr(B, A) = \\Pr(B \\mid A)\\Pr(A),\n\\]\nfrom which we can see that if we know the conditional distribution \\(\\Pr(B \\mid A)\\) and the marginal distribution \\(\\Pr(A)\\), we can combine these (via multiplication) to obtain the joint distribution \\(\\Pr(B,A)\\)."

    "text": "Moving to Continuous World\nThe reason I’ve spent so much time focusing on the discrete case here is because the intuitions we just built do indeed translate naturally into good intuitions for reasoning about continuous distributions!\nTaking our discrete table, for example, we can imagine moving into continuous space the same way that we learned how to take discrete rectangles approximating the the space underneath a curve and convert them into integrals: by taking the limit of the area of these rectangles as they got skinnier and skinnier:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above figure, we see how we can imagine summing the area of rectangles approximating the area “under” the curve (really, between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis), then imagine the rectangles becoming skinnier and skinnier such that the sum of the rectangles’ areas converges to the integral of the function.\nSimilarly, now imagine taking the above table and continuizing our variables: imagine that instead of a student’s progress in school being recorded by a discrete random variable \\(G\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{R}_G = \\{10, 11, 12\\}\\), now we record a student’s progress using a continuous random variable \\(G\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{R}_G = [10,12] \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\).\nBy the same logic, rather than tracking each student’s honor status using a discrete random variable \\(H\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{R}_H = \\{0, 1\\}\\), now we keep track of a student’s honor status using a continuous random variable \\(H\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{R}_H = [0, 1] \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\).\nIn this new continuous world, therefore, we might say that a student near the beginning of 10th grade who is towards the “high end” of the “honors spectrum” might be represented by a pair of values \\(G = 10.03\\) and \\(H = 0.95\\), for example.\nHowever, in this case we can still derive all of the distributions from other distributions in the same way, by:\n\nReplacing the sums we computed above with integrals, and\nReplacing the operation of re-normalization (which we performed to ensure that our probability mass values summed to 1) with the operation of ensuring that our probability density values integrate to 1.\n\nSo, for example, now rather than being given a frequency table, we may just be given the information that students’ \\(G\\) values are distributed according to the continuous uniform distribution, \\(G \\sim \\mathcal{U}(10, 12)\\), that their \\(H\\) values are distributed according to the truncated normal distribution \\(\\mathcal{TN}(\\mu = 0.5, \\sigma = 0.1, a = 0, b = 1)\\)1, and that these two variables are independent, which means that \\(\\Pr(G \\mid H) = \\Pr(G)\\) and \\(\\Pr(H \\mid G) = \\Pr(H)\\) (the conditional distributions are the marginal distributions).\nIn this case, then, we know (by the definition of independence) that we can obtain the joint pdf \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) by just multiplying the pdf of the marginal distribution of \\(G\\), \\(f_G(v_G)\\) and the pdf of the marginal distribution of \\(H\\), \\(f_H(v_H)\\):\n\\[\nf_{G,H}(v_G, v_H) = f_G(v_G) \\cdot f_H(v_H).\n\\]\nSince we know that \\(G\\) has a continuous uniform distribution, \\(G \\sim \\mathcal{U}(10,12)\\), we know (or we could look up) that \\(G\\) has pdf\n\\[\nf_G(v_G) = \\frac{1}{12 - 10} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\nSince we know that \\(H\\) has a truncated normal distribution, \\(H \\sim \\mathcal{TN}(0.5, 0.1, 0, 1)\\), we know (or we could look up) that \\(H\\) has the pdf\n\\[\nf_H(v_H) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\frac{\\varphi(\\frac{v_H-\\mu}{\\sigma})}{\\Phi(\\frac{b-\\mu}{\\sigma}) - \\Phi(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma})},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\varphi\\) is the pdf of the standard normal distribution \\(\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\) and \\(\\Phi\\) is the CDF of the standard normal distribution \\(\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\) (note the consistent usage of lowercase letters to describe pdfs and capital letters to describe CDFs, even in Greek!).\nTherefore, given the independence condition, we can obtain the joint pdf \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) by just multiplying these pdfs:\n\\[\nf_{G,H}(v_G, v_H) = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma}\\frac{\\varphi(\\frac{v_H-\\mu}{\\sigma})}{\\Phi(\\frac{b-\\mu}{\\sigma}) - \\Phi(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma})}.\n\\]\nAnd, given this joint pdf, we can integrate wherever we took sums in the discrete case to obtain the marginal pdfs:\n\\[\nf_G(v_G) = \\int_{0}^{1}f_{G,H}(v_G,v_H)dv_H\n\\]\nor\n\\[\nf_H(v_H) = \\int_{10}^{12}f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)dv_G\n\\]\nAnd we can compute conditional pdfs by renormalizing so that the denominator is no longer the integral of the distribution over all its possible values (hence just the number \\(1\\)) but a ratio of joint distribution to marginal distribution values like the following:\n\\[\nf_{H \\mid G}(v_H | v_G) = \\frac{f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)}{f_G(v_G)}.\n\\]\nSo, while the continuous case does have scarier math than the discrete case, I hope that rather than “lingering” in the continuous world, trying to churn through the meaning of the above equations on their own, you can instead try to link the continuous equations back to their simpler discrete forms given in the previous section, then just convert sums to integrals to complete the picture. That way, you never have to just stare at an integral-filled equation again.\nFor example, given two continuous variables with confusing-looking pdfs or CDFs, start by discretizing (“binning”) the possible values of these continuous values, to obtain a discrete distribution, and build up your intuitions about the relationships between the variables in discrete world.\nIn the previous case, for example, if you were asked to start with the continuous version where \\(G\\) ranges continuously across \\([10,12]\\) and \\(H\\) ranges continuously across \\([0,1]\\), you could start by discretizing these continuous distributions to obtain a table very similar to the table presented at the very beginning of this writeup: if you split the range \\([10,12]\\) into three bins of equal length, and the range \\([0,1]\\) into two bins of equal length, you can start by sampling (say) 1000 \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) values using code, sorting these 1000 samples into these equal-length bins, and reasoning through what the joint/marginal/conditional distributions of this binned distribution look like, before moving back over into continuous world to complete the various portions of the problem…"

    "text": "Finding The Issue By Thinking Geometrically\nThere are a lot of ways we could stop and try to diagnose what’s going on here, but the approach that helped me most in thinking through this problem was to plot out the space over which we’re integrating the joint pdf, geometrically:\nHere I create what is sometimes called a “mesh grid”, by running the expand_grid() function (from tidyverse, which replaces the base-R expand.grid() function you have already seen, but isn’t very different) to create a grid of points, where these points’ \\(x\\) values are drawn from x and their \\(y\\) values are drawn from y:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nx &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 2, by = 0.01)\ny &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 3, by = 0.01)\nxy_df &lt;- expand_grid(x, y)\n# Display the first and last 6 rows\nxy_df |&gt; head(); xy_df |&gt; tail()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.00\n\n\n0\n0.01\n\n\n0\n0.02\n\n\n0\n0.03\n\n\n0\n0.04\n\n\n0\n0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n2\n2.95\n\n\n2\n2.96\n\n\n2\n2.97\n\n\n2\n2.98\n\n\n2\n2.99\n\n\n2\n3.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext I use the mutate() function to create a new variable, x_leq_y, on the basis of this grid, and look at the count of the number of points in my grid which do and do not satisfy the boolean expression x &lt;= y:\n\n\nCode\nxy_df &lt;- xy_df |&gt; mutate(\n  x_leq_y = as.numeric(x &lt;= y)\n)\nxy_df |&gt; group_by(x_leq_y) |&gt; count(.drop=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx_leq_y\nn\n\n\n\n\n0\n20100\n\n\n1\n40401\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I use ggplot with the geom_tile() geometry to create a simple but helpful visualization of the subset of \\([0,2] \\times [0,3]\\) within which the boolean condition is true (and where I have explicitly drawn lines showing the boundaries within which the point \\((x,y)\\) has a non-zero probability density, as well as the function \\(f(x) = x\\), which will both come in handy later):\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(latex2exp)\nggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x) x) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    fill = TeX(\"$X \\\\leq Y$\"),\n    title = \"The Integration Space, in 2D\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(labels=c(\"False\",\"True\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now let’s use this plot to think about what we’re doing in both Approach 1 and Approach 2.\n\nApproach 1\nTo think through the double integral in this case, visually, I like to imagine “sweeping” over the space across one dimension when computing the inner integral, then “sweeping” over the space across the other dimension when computing the outer integral.\nRemember that the double integral in Approach 1 was set up as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(X \\leq Y) &= \\int_{0}^{2}\\int_{x}^{3}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dy~dx\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nSo, in this case, we can add some arrows to our plot to show the “sweeping” which is occurring when we compute the inner integral. Since the inner integral is from \\(y = x\\) to \\(y = 3\\), I think of arrows sweeping upwards from the line \\(y = x\\) to the (horizontal) line \\(y = 3\\).\nSo, to make the diagram on the left side of the figure below, which represents the inner integral, I use:\n\nDashed yellow lines to represent the bounds between which we’re “sweeping”, and\nDashed arrows to represent the direction of the sweeping\n\nThen to make the diagram on the right, which represents the outer integral, I use:\n\nSolid yellow lines to represent the bounds between which we’re sweeping, and\nSolid arrows to represent the direction of the sweeping\n\nWhich means that ultimately, after computing the two integrals, we have integrated over the region of the \\(xy\\)-plane bounded by the dashed and solid yellow lines.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(latex2exp)\n# blw = Boundary line width\nblw &lt;- 1\n# blc = Boundary line color\nblc &lt;- 'yellow'\na1_inner_xvals &lt;- c(0.05, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.95)\na1_inner_df &lt;- tibble(x=a1_inner_xvals)\na1_inner_df &lt;- a1_inner_df |&gt; mutate(\n    xend = x,\n    y = x,\n    yend = 3\n)\na1_inner_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x) x) +\n  geom_segment(data=a1_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  # Inner integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=2, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A1.1: Inner Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\n\na1_outer_yvals &lt;- c(0.05, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 2.95)\na1_outer_df &lt;- tibble(y=a1_outer_yvals)\na1_outer_df &lt;- a1_outer_df |&gt; mutate(\n    yend = y,\n    x = 0,\n    xend = 2\n)\n\na1_outer_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a1_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a1_outer_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='solid', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x) x) +\n  # Inner integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=2, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Outer integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='solid') +\n  # Outer integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='solid') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A1.2: Outer Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\na1_inner_plot + a1_outer_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nNote how, since the inner integral in this case already excluded all points lying beneath the line \\(y = x\\) (the dashed yellow diagonal line), it actually didn’t matter that our outer integral went over this “boundary line”: the overall result of the double-integration only sums up the values of the pdf in the range bounded by the yellow lines. In other words, even though the outer integral does “sweep” over the dashed yellow diagonal \\(y = x\\) line, thus sweeping outside of the range of valid values of \\(x\\), it did not have any density here to sum up, since all of the probability density in this red triangle had been left out of the inner integral.\n(If that last paragraph didn’t make sense to you, don’t worry about it! Just stick to the pictures for intuition)\n\n\nApproach 2\nOn the other hand, recall that the double integral in Approach 2 was set up as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(X \\leq Y) &= \\int_{0}^{3}\\int_{0}^{y}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dx~dy\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nGiven this double integral setup, we can employ this same way of thinking about integration (as “sweeping” across a dimension) to obtain the following diagram, which helps illustrate why we obtain a value greater than 1 in this case:\n\n\nCode\na2_inner_yvals &lt;- c(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 2.95)\na2_inner_df &lt;- tibble(y=a2_inner_yvals)\na2_inner_df &lt;- a2_inner_df |&gt; mutate(\n    yend = y,\n    x = 0.05,\n    xend = y\n)\nribbon_xvals &lt;- seq(from = 2, to = 3, by = 0.01)\nribbon_df &lt;- tibble(x=ribbon_xvals, y=ribbon_xvals)\na2_inner_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a2_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_ribbon(data=ribbon_df, aes(x=x, ymin=y, ymax=3), alpha=0.333) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun=function(x) x) +\n  # Inner integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=3, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A2.1: Inner Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\n\na2_outer_xvals &lt;- c(0.05, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.95, 2.5, 2.95)\na2_outer_df &lt;- tibble(x=a2_outer_xvals)\na2_outer_df &lt;- a2_outer_df |&gt; mutate(\n    xend = x,\n    y = 0,\n    yend = 2.95\n)\n\na2_outer_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a2_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a2_outer_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='solid', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_ribbon(data=ribbon_df, aes(x=x, ymin=y, ymax=3), alpha=0.333) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun=function(x) x) +\n  # Inner integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=3, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Outer integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=3, yend=0, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='solid') +\n  # Outer integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=3, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='solid') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A2.2: Outer Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\na2_inner_plot + a2_outer_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we see that, whereas in Approach 1 everything worked out since the line \\(y = x\\) was suitable as a mathematical representation of the entire lower bound of \\(y\\), here in Approach 2 we cannot use the line \\(y = x\\) on its own to characterize the upper bound on \\(x\\), since this will include the grey triangle in the diagram above as part of the region over which we’re integrating the joint pdf."

In other words, by looking at the above diagram, we can see that the following modification to our integral in Approach 2 would technically “work” to fix the problem, if it was easy to compute:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(X \\leq Y) &= \\int_{0}^{3}\\int_{0}^{\\min(2, y)}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dx~dy\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nOne way of thinking about this is, if we had set our upper bounds in Approach 2 this way, the diagram showing the “sweeping” over the \\(x\\) dimension would instead look like the following, where the yellow line traces out \\(x = \\min(2,y)\\) instead of \\(x = y\\) (the black line):\n\n\nCode\na2_inner_df_fixed &lt;- a2_inner_df |&gt; mutate(\n  xend = ifelse(xend &gt;= 2, 2, xend)\n)\na2_fixed_inner_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a2_inner_df_fixed, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_ribbon(data=ribbon_df, aes(x=x, ymin=y, ymax=3), alpha=0.333) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun=function(x) x) +\n  # Inner integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound, segment 1\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=2, xend=2, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound, segment 2\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=2, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A2.1: Inner Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\n\na2_outer_df_fixed &lt;- a2_outer_df |&gt; filter(x &lt;= 2)\n\na2_fixed_outer_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a2_inner_df_fixed, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a2_outer_df_fixed, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='solid', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_ribbon(data=ribbon_df, aes(x=x, ymin=y, ymax=3), alpha=0.333) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun=function(x) x) +\n  # Inner integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound, segment 1\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=2, xend=2, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound, segment 2\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=2, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Outer integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='solid') +\n  # Outer integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='solid') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A2.2: Outer Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\na2_fixed_inner_plot + a2_fixed_outer_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding \\(\\min()\\): A Quick Fix\nSince including fancy functions like \\(\\min()\\) and/or \\(\\max()\\) in our integral bounds makes things more complicated (to me, at least), one “quick fix” way to handle this would be to just take the result of the original Approach 2 integral and subtract out the integral of the joint pdf within the grey triangle in the above diagrams.\n\n\nA More Practical/“Correct” Approach\nHowever, the more “correct” way in a sense would be to ensure that we are never integrating over an area that is not in the support of \\((X,Y)\\). To accomplish this, we can observe that our Approach 2 integral would have worked and would have integrated only over the support of \\((X,Y)\\) if we had broken it up as follows:\n\\[\n\\Pr(X \\leq Y) = \\int_{0}^{2}\\int_{0}^{y}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dx~dy + \\int_{2}^{3}\\int_{0}^{2}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dx~dy\n\\]\nThus we’ll call this way of integrating Approach 3, which can be visualized as follows:\n\n\nCode\na31_inner_yvals &lt;- c(0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.95)\na31_inner_df &lt;- tibble(y=a31_inner_yvals)\na31_inner_df &lt;- a31_inner_df |&gt; mutate(\n    yend = y,\n    x = 0.05,\n    xend = y\n)\na31_outer_xvals &lt;- c(0.05, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.95)\na31_outer_df &lt;- tibble(x=a31_outer_xvals)\na31_outer_df &lt;- a31_outer_df |&gt; mutate(\n    xend = x,\n    y = 0.05,\n    yend = 2\n)\na31_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a31_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a31_outer_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='solid', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun=function(x) x) +\n  # Lower bound, inner integral\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=2, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Upper bound, inner integral\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=2, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Lower bound, outer integral\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='solid') +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=2, xend=2, yend=2, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='solid') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A3.1: First Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\n\na32_inner_yvals &lt;- c(2.05, 2.5, 2.95)\na32_inner_df &lt;- tibble(y=a32_inner_yvals)\na32_inner_df &lt;- a32_inner_df |&gt; mutate(\n    yend = y,\n    x = 0,\n    xend = 1.95\n)\na32_outer_xvals &lt;- c(0.05, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.95)\na32_outer_df &lt;- tibble(x=a32_outer_xvals)\na32_outer_df &lt;- a32_outer_df |&gt; mutate(\n    xend = x,\n    y = 2,\n    yend = 2.95\n)\n\na32_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a32_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a32_outer_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='solid', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  # Lower bound of inner integral\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=2, xend=0, yend=3, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='dashed') +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=2, xend=2, yend=3, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='dashed') +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='solid') +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=2, xend=2, yend=2, color='yellow', linewidth=1, linetype='solid') +\n  stat_function(fun=function(x) x) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A3.2: Second Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\na31_plot + a32_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we see that the following steps give us the correct result:\n\nWe first integrate the joint pdf over the region displayed on the left: the triangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((0,2)\\), and \\((2,2)\\))\nWe then integrate the joint pdf separately over the region displayed on the right: the square with vertices at \\((0,2)\\), \\((0,3)\\), \\((2,2)\\), and \\((2,3)\\)\nAnd then we obtain the total density of the pdf within the admissible (green) region by adding these two results together\n\nMathematically, this gives us (skipping many steps like we did before):\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(X \\leq Y) &= \\int_{0}^{2}\\int_{0}^{y}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dx~dy + \\int_{2}^{3}\\int_{0}^{2}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dx~dy \\\\\n&= \\frac{29}{165} + \\frac{7}{11} = \\frac{134}{165} \\approx 0.812,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nmatching the result from our original integral, performed in the opposite order.\nHopefully this way of breaking down the relationship between integration and probability can help you out: if you find yourself staring at a problem for too long, try breaking your brain out of the rut by seeing if diagrams like the above can help you reason through what the bounds of your integrals should be 😎"

    "section": "Step 0: What Do I Mean By “Simulating” a Sample Space?",
    "text": "Step 0: What Do I Mean By “Simulating” a Sample Space?\nWhat I’m referring to here is, for example, the information you are given at the top of Quiz 1, stating that a random sample contained:\n\n340 people currently using an iPhone,\n185 people using a different phone who don’t want to switch phones ever, and\n232 people using a different phone but hoping to switch to an iPhone in the future.\n\nThe idea is that we can generate a tibble which “encodes” this information in its rows, by allowing us to use the naïve definition of probability to compute probabilities of particular types of people: for example, say we are interested in the probability that a person in our sample uses an iPhone. Mathematically (by the naïve definition), if we construct a random variable \\(F\\) (for iFone, of course) representing the outcome of a randomly-selected person’s phone type (so that \\(F = 1\\) if the person we ask ends up being an iPhone user, and \\(F = 0\\) otherwise), then we can use the information from our sample to compute \\(\\Pr(F = 1)\\) as\n\\[\n\\Pr(F = 1) = \\frac{\\#\\text{ iPhone users in sample}}{\\#\\text{ People in sample}}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThis means, therefore, that if we had a tibble called df where each row contained information on one particular person from our sample, then we could “translate” this naive definition formula into code as something like\nprob_F &lt;- nrow(df[df$iphone == 1,]) / nrow(df)\nSince here df[df$iphone == 1,] would subset the full df to keep only those rows corresponding to people with iPhones, while df itself (without any filters applied) would contain a row for each person. Literally, we are applying the following “translation” of the naïve definition-based formula (Equation 1) into code:\n\\[\n\\Pr(F = 1) = \\frac{\\overbrace{\\#}^{\\texttt{nrow}}\\overbrace{\\text{ iPhone users in sample}}^{\\texttt{df[df\\$iphone == 1]}}}{\\underbrace{\\#}_{\\texttt{nrow}}\\underbrace{\\text{ People in sample}}_{\\texttt{df}}}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nSimilarly, say we wanted to compute a conditional probability on the basis of our sample, like the probability of a person liking the feature (the feature mentioned in the quiz) given that they are an iPhone user. In this case, let \\(L\\) be an RV such that \\(L = 1\\) if the person likes the feature and \\(L = 0\\) otherwise. Then we can represent the probability we want in this case mathematically using the definition of conditional probability:\n\\[\n\\Pr(L = 1 \\mid F = 1) = \\frac{\\Pr(L = 1 \\cap F = 1)}{\\Pr(F = 1)}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nAnd then we can interpret this ratio (of \\(\\Pr(L = 1 \\cap F = 1)\\) to \\(\\Pr(F = 1)\\) using the naïve definition of probability to derive a new “naïve definition-based equation for the same conditional probability” written mathematically in Equation 3:\n\\[\n\\Pr(L = 1 \\mid F = 1) = \\frac{\\#\\text{ iPhone users in sample who like feature}}{\\#\\text{ iPhone users in sample}}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nIn this case, since both the numerator and denominator are restricted to only those people in our sample who are iPhone users, we can make our lives easy by creating a new “only iPhone users” tibble, using code like\niphone_df &lt;- df[df$iphone == 1,]\nAnd, with this iPhone-users-only tibble now available to us, Equation 4 can be translated into code similarly to how we translated Equation 1 into code, as\nprob_L_given_F &lt;- nrow(iphone_df[iphone_df$like_feature == 1]) / nrow(iphone_df)\nWhere once again we have just applied the following set of “translations” to the naïve definition (this time the “conditional naïve definition”):\n\\[\n\\Pr(L = 1 \\mid F = 1) = \\frac{\\overbrace{\\#}^{\\texttt{nrow}}\\overbrace{\\text{ iPhone users in sample who like feature}}^{\\texttt{iphone\\_df[iphone\\_df\\$likes\\_feature == 1]}}}{\\underbrace{\\#}_{\\texttt{nrow}}\\underbrace{\\text{ iPhone users in sample}}_{\\texttt{iphone\\_df}}}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nSo, all of the above shows you how to work with a sample-space-simulating tibble, once you have created it. The following steps will show you how to create such a sample-space-simulating tibble using functions from the tidyverse."

    "text": "Step 4: Combining the Type-Rows\nNow that we have these six objects, each representing a particular type of person that could be in our sample, replicated the correct number of times based on our calculations from the information given in the problem, we can combine them to form a single, combined tibble by using the bind_rows() function from dplyr as follows (sorry this line looks so packed/scary: we could have done all this in a loop or something that looks a bit “nicer”, but here I thought writing it all out could help with understanding, especially since there are only 6, rather than 8, possible types):\n\nsample_df &lt;- bind_rows(\n    type1_rows, type2_rows, type3_rows,\n    type4_rows, type5_rows, type6_rows\n)\n\nEven though printing the head() or tail() of this dataset will not be that helpful for ensuring that we created everything correctly, we can at least check that the dimensions are correct, as we’re expecting the sample to contain 757 people (rows) in total, with 3 pieces of information (columns) for each person:\n\ndim(sample_df)\n\n[1] 757   3\n\n\nWe could also check, as a way of starting the type of computations mentioned in Step 0, the number of people within the full sample_df dataset who match some filter—in this case, for example, the number of people who are iPhone users:\n\niphone_df &lt;- sample_df[sample_df$iphone == 1,]\ndim(iphone_df)\n\n[1] 340   3\n\n\nAnd this tells us that again, the number of rows in this subset matches what we expected—more evidence that we’ve constructed things correctly.\nNow that we’ve created the iphone_df that was mentioned as part of Step 0, we can carry out the one final step of computing a conditional probability using this iphone_df object, in precisely the way described in Step 0: to get the conditional probability that someone in the sample likes the feature given that they are an iPhone user, \\(\\Pr(L = 1 \\mid F = 1)\\), we just compute\n\nnrow(iphone_df[iphone_df$likes_feature == 1,]) / nrow(iphone_df)\n\n[1] 0.8\n\n\nwhich once again matches the information given in the problem.

    "text": "(Optional) Step 5: Wrapping the Row Duplication in a Function\nIf you’re like me, and you find that typing slice(rep(1:n(), k)) over and over again is scary and could easily lead to mistakes, you can wrap this whole process in a function to make your life easier. For example, we can define a function called duplicate_row which takes an argument tr representing a tibble_row object and another argument num_reps specifying how many times that tibble_row should be repeated:\n\nduplicate_row &lt;- function(tr, num_reps) {\n    return(tr |&gt; slice(rep(1:n(), num_reps)))\n}\n\nAnd now rather than writing the whole operation over and over again, we can just call duplicate_row as often as needed. If you wanted a tibble which contained the numbers 1 through 5 repeated that many times, for example (that is, the number 1 repeated 1 time, the number 2 repeated 2 times, and so on), this could be done in a loop using our duplicate_row function as follows:\n\n# Create a single row containing the number 1\nfull_tibble &lt;- tibble_row(n = 1)\n# Create 2 rows containing the number 2 and add\n# those 2 rows to full_tibble, then create 3 rows\n# containing the number 3 and add those 3 rows\n# to full_tibble, and so on\nfor (i in 2:5) {\n    row_containing_i &lt;- tibble_row(n = i)\n    repeated_rows &lt;- duplicate_row(row_containing_i, i)\n    full_tibble &lt;- bind_rows(full_tibble, repeated_rows)\n}\ndim(full_tibble)\n\n[1] 15  1\n\nfull_tibble\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope that helps a bit, in case this scenario ever comes up again on a homework or quiz, or it comes up on your project or at some point in your future data science career!"

The counts for the final two rows, \\(\\#(F = 1, W = 1, L = 0)\\) and \\(\\#(F = 1, W = 1, L = 1)\\) are both zero, since we defined \\(W\\) for iPhone users to always be \\(0\\), since they already have the iPhone so cannot want to switch to the iPhone. This gives us the bottom half of the count column.\nFor the top half, we compute as follows: the top half (first four rows) represent all of the non-iPhone users. Since there are\n\\[\n340 + 185 + 232 = 757\n\\]\npeople in total, and 340 are iPhone users, this means that\n\\[\n757 - 340 = 417\n\\]\nmust be non-iPhone users (which we also could have computed by adding the 185 and 232 given in the problem): \\(\\#(F = 0) = 417\\).\nOf these 417, we are also given that 185 don’t want to switch, while 232 do want to switch, so\n\n\\(\\#(F = 0, W = 0) = 185\\) and\n\\(\\#(F = 0, W = 1) = 232\\).\n\nThe final piece of info we need is the info given in the problem that 52% of the no-switch people like the feature, while only 48% of the hope-to-switch people like the feature.\nSince “no-switch people” are people with the properties \\((F = 0, W = 0)\\), and “hope-to-switch people” are people with the properties \\((F = 0, W = 1)\\), we can use these given conditional probabilities to compute the remaining counts in our table as follows:\nNo-switch people who like the feature:\nWe are given the info that, among no-switch people, 52% like the feature.

Concretely, to see what’s going on, let’s just look at the row filter we’ve provided (the portion of the full code that is within the square brackets [], before the comma):\n\nsample(nrow(deck_df), 15, replace = TRUE)\n\n [1] 30 32 30 46  7 30 46 27 21 42 25 26 17 35  4\n\n\nWe see that, in fact, we are not really sampling from the data.frame itself, so much as sampling from a list of its indices (from 1 to 52), and then after performing this sample we are going and asking R to give us the rows at the indices that ended up in this sample. Keeping this distinction in mind (between the rows themselves and their indices) can be helpful for debugging code like this."

In words: the result of (left) matrix-multiplying \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) by \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is the same as scalar-multiplying \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) by a factor of \\(\\lambda\\). In our case the Eigenvector is \\(\\mathbf{r}^*\\) and the Eigenvalue is \\(\\lambda = 1\\), since \\(\\mathbf{E}\\mathbf{r}^* = 1 \\cdot \\mathbf{r}^*\\).For the math-curious, there are lots of fun results from matrix theory which assure us that \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) is guaranteed to have principal eigenvalue \\(\\lambda = 1\\) 💆"
