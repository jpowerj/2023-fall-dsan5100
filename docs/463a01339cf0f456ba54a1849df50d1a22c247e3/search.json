    "text": "Proposition \\(p\\): A true-false statement like “1 + 1 = 2” or “\\(x\\) is greater than 5”. The latter would be written as \\(p(x)\\), since its true/false value depends on a given value of \\(x\\).\n\\(\\wedge\\): Logical “and”. \\(p \\wedge q\\) is true only if both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true.\n\\(\\vee\\): Logical “or”. \\(p \\vee q\\) is true if \\(p\\) is true or \\(q\\) is true, or both are true.\n\\(\\neg\\): Logical negation: If \\(p\\) is true, \\(\\neg p\\) is false. If \\(p\\) is false, \\(\\neg p\\) is true.\nDeMorgan’s Laws: Logical identities which illustrate how the negation operator gets “distributed” in a logical statement, allowing conversion of “or” statements into “and” statements, and vice-versa: \\(\\neg(p \\wedge q) = \\neg(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q)\\)\n\\(\\implies\\): “Implies”. \\(a \\implies b\\) is true if, whenever \\(a\\) is true, \\(b\\) is also true.\n\\(\\iff\\): “If and only if”. \\(a \\iff b\\) is true if, \\(a\\) is only true when \\(b\\) is true, and \\(a\\) is only false when \\(b\\) is false.\n\\(\\exists\\): “There exists”. In the course this will be written as \\(\\exists x \\in S [p(x)]\\), which means that there exists some element \\(x\\) in the set \\(S\\) such that \\(p(x)\\) is true. Also called the “existential quantifier”.\n\\(\\forall\\): “For all”. In the course this will be written as \\(\\forall x \\in S [p(x)]\\), which means that for every element in a set \\(S\\) (with \\(x\\) representing some element arbitrarily taken from \\(S\\)), the proposition \\(p(x)\\) is true. Also called the “universal quantifier”.\n\nNote that the universal and existential quantifiers are closely related by a negation law (just like \\(\\wedge\\) and \\(\\vee\\) and their connection via DeMorgan’s Laws): \\(\\neg \\left( \\forall x \\in S[p(x)] \\right) \\iff \\exists x \\in S [\\neg p(x)]\\). The negation on the outside of the quantified proposition has moved inside of it, with the quantifier flipped.\nThe same holds true in reverse: \\(\\neg \\left( \\exists x \\in S [p(x)] \\right) \\iff \\forall x \\in S [\\neg p(x)]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA set \\(S\\) (denoted by a capital letter when possible) is a collection of elements (denoted by a lowercase letter when possible).\n\nFor example, if \\(S = \\{0,1,2,3\\}\\), then \\(0\\) is an element of \\(S\\).\n\n\\(a \\in S\\): The proposition that \\(a\\) is an element of the set \\(S\\).\n\nIf \\(S = \\{0,1,2,3\\}\\), then \\(2 \\in S\\) but \\(5 \\notin S\\).\n\n\\(A \\subseteq S\\): The proposition that \\(A\\) is a subset of the set \\(S\\).\n\nIf \\(S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\), then \\(\\{1,3\\} \\subseteq S\\) but \\(\\{1,4\\} \\not\\subseteq S\\). Note that sets are defined to be subsets of themselves, so that \\(S \\subseteq S\\).\n\n\\(A \\subset S\\): The proposition that \\(A\\) is a proper subset of \\(S\\), meaning that \\(A \\subseteq S\\) but \\(A \\neq S\\).\n\nWhile sets are subsets of themselves, sets are not proper subsets of themselves, so that if \\(S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\), then \\(\\{1,2,3\\} \\subset S\\) but \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} \\not\\subset S\\).\n\n\\(|S|\\): The cardinality of, or number of elements in, a set \\(S\\).\n\nIf \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\), \\(|S| = 3\\).\nIf the set \\(S\\) has infinite cardinality, we can distinguish between two cases:\n\nIf elements of \\(S\\) can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), we say that \\(S\\) is countably infinite and has cardinality \\(\\aleph_0\\) (pronounced “aleph-null”): \\(|S| = \\aleph_0\\).\nIf elements of \\(S\\) cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), we say that \\(S\\) is uncountably infinite and has cardinality greater than \\(\\aleph_0\\): \\(|S| &gt; \\aleph_0\\).\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(S)\\): The power set of a set \\(S\\), which is the set of all possible subsets of \\(S\\).\n\nFor example, if \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\), \\(\\mathcal{P}(S) = \\{\\varnothing, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{1,2,3\\}\\}\\). Notice that \\(|\\mathcal{P}(S)| = 2^{|S|}\\), which is always true of the power set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbb{N}\\): The set of all natural numbers, sometimes called the “counting numbers”: \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\}\\) (This set is countably infinite).\n\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\): The set of all integers, which includes all of the natural numbers along with their negatives: \\(\\{\\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}\\) (This set is also countably infinite)\n\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\): The set of all rational numbers, i.e., well-defined ratios of two integers. \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\iff x = \\frac{p}{q}\\) for two integers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), and \\(q \\neq 0\\). (This set is, surprisingly, also countably infinite)\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\): The set of all real numbers, which includes all integers as well as numbers such as \\(\\pi\\), \\(2.356\\), or \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) (This set is uncountably infinite).\nScalar: A single number from some set of numbers, like \\(-2.1 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\)\nVector: A \\(d\\)-dimensional vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a collection of \\(d\\) scalars in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_d)^\\top\\), which we can interpret as an arrow pointing \\(v_i\\) units in each dimension \\(i\\). For example, if \\(\\mathbf{v} = (3,5)\\), we can interpret \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) as representing an arrow pointing \\(3\\) units in the \\(x\\) direction and \\(5\\) units in the \\(y\\) direction.\n\nAs indicated above, however, we will assume that vectors are column vectors unless otherwise specified, though they will be written row-wise with a transpose symbol at the end. This means that, although it will be written like \\(\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n)^\\top\\), you should apply the transpose in your head: \\[\n\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n)^\\top = \\begin{bmatrix}v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nMatrix: An \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}_{[m \\times n]}\\) is an \\(m\\)-by-\\(n\\) grid of scalars, where the scalar in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column is denoted \\(m_{i,j}\\). In the class, we will be careful to add a subscript like \\(\\mathbf{M}_{[m \\times n]}\\) to indicate the number of rows (\\(m\\)) and columns (\\(n\\)) in the matrix, since operations like multiplication are only defined for matrices with particular dimensions.\nMatrix multiplication: For two matrices \\(\\mathbf{X}_{[a \\times b]}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{[c \\times d]}\\), matrix multiplication is defined if \\(b = c\\), and produces the following \\(a \\times d\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{XY}_{[a \\times d]}\\):\n\\[\n  \\mathbf{XY}_{[a \\times d]} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  x_{1,1}y_{1,1} & \\cdots & x_{m,1}y_{1,n} \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  x_{1,n}y_{m,1} & \\cdots & x_{m,n}y_{m,n}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n f(i)\\): \\(\\Sigma\\) is the capitalized Greek letter “Sigma”, and stands for “Sum” in this case. This notation means: “the sum of \\(f(i)\\) from \\(i = 1\\) to \\(i = n\\)”. For example, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^3 i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14\\).\n\\(\\prod_{i=1}^n f(i)\\): \\(\\Pi\\) is the capitalized Greek letter “Pi”, and stands for “Product” in this case. This notation means: “the product of \\(f(i)\\) from \\(i = 1\\) to \\(i = n\\)”. For example, \\(\\prod_{i=1}^3 i^2 = 1^2 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 36\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\\([a,b] \\in \\mathbb{R}\\): The closed interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) containing all numbers between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), including \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) themselves.\n\\((a,b) \\in \\mathbb{R}\\): The open interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) containing all numbers between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), excluding \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) themselves.\n\\([a, b)\\), \\((a, b]\\): The half-open interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In the first case, we include \\(a\\) but exclude \\(b\\), while in the second we exclude \\(a\\) but include \\(b\\).\n\\(\\int_{a}^b f(x)dx\\): The integral of the function \\(f(x)\\) between points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In this course, you just need to remember that this produces the area under the curve of \\(f(x)\\) between these points.\n\\(\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ f(x) \\right]\\): The derivative of the function \\(f(x)\\). For this class, you just need to remember that the derivative is what transforms a Cumulative Density Function (CDF) into a Probability Density Function (PDF): if \\(F_X(v)\\) is the CDF of a random variable \\(X\\), then \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[ F_X(v) \\right] = f_X(v)\\), the PDF of \\(X\\).\n\nFor functions of multiple variables, like the joint pdf \\(f_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\), we use the \\(\\partial\\) symbol instead of \\(d\\) to denote partial derivatives: for example, the change in \\(F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\) as \\(v_X\\) changes is denoted \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_X}\\left[ F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y) \\right]\\), while the change in \\(F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\) as \\(v_Y\\) changes is denoted \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_Y}\\left[ F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y) \\right]\\)."

Concretely, to see what’s going on, let’s just look at the row filter we’ve provided (the portion of the full code that is within the square brackets [], before the comma):\n\nsample(nrow(deck_df), 15, replace = TRUE)\n\n [1] 30 32 30 46  7 30 46 27 21 42 25 26 17 35  4\n\n\nWe see that, in fact, we are not really sampling from the data.frame itself, so much as sampling from a list of its indices (from 1 to 52), and then after performing this sample we are going and asking R to give us the rows at the indices that ended up in this sample. Keeping this distinction in mind (between the rows themselves and their indices) can be helpful for debugging code like this."

    "text": "Approach 2: Using R Like a Fancy Calculator\nIn this approach, we basically just use R (or Python, or whatever else) as a glorified calculator. We take the hard part—reasoning about what the sample space might look like, for example, or whether events are independent—and do it in our heads, then use R to figure out what happens when we multiply/add/divide the things we already figured out.\nContinuing the dice example, for instance, this approach would go something like: we ask you\n\nWhat is the probability that you observe a roll greater than 4, followed by a roll less than or equal to 4, followed by a roll greater than 4?\n\nand you reason through this like,\n\nI already know that there are 6 outcomes, and that they’re all equally likely, so that the probability of seeing a particular outcome in \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) is always \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). Therefore I can define an event \\(E_&gt;\\) representing the event of observing an outcome greater than 4, and another event \\(E_\\leq\\) of observing an outcome less than or equal to 4. I know that\n\n\n\nSince the possible outcomes greater than 4 are 5 and 6, my event \\(E_&gt; = \\{5, 6\\}\\), and since \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), I can compute the probability of \\(E_&gt;\\) as \\[\n\\Pr(E_&gt;) = \\frac{|E_&gt;|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{|\\{5, 6\\}|}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSince the possible outcomes less than or equal to 4 are 1, 2, 3, and 4, my event \\(E_\\leq = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\), so I can compute the probability of \\(E_\\leq\\) as \\[\n\\Pr(E_\\leq) = \\frac{|E_\\leq|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{|\\{1, 2, 3, 4|}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAnd now I can use R with these probabilities I computed in my head to derive the probabilities of them occurring in a particular sequence:\n\n\n# Encode probabilities of my two events\np_greater &lt;- 1/3\np_less_or_equal &lt;- 2/3\n# Use them to compute the probabilities of sequences\np_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\np_sequence\n\n[1] 0.07407407\n\n\nThis approach may seem boring at first, since again we could have done this just on a calculator, but it becomes interesting when we ask you to vary the numbers to see what happens to the resulting probabilities.\nFor example, if you wrote the above code for some problem, then in the next problem we could say “It turns out the person providing you with the dice was cheating! They rigged it so that there’s actually a 99% chance of getting a number greater than 4! Go back and compute the probability of this sequence but using the rigged die”\nAnd then you could just change the first line of your code, and re-run the whole thing, to obtain the new probability:\n\np_greater &lt;- 0.99\np_less_or_equal &lt;- 0.01\np_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\np_sequence\n\n[1] 0.009801\n\n\nFinally, we might then ask you something like:\n“Your friend actually invented a machine that can generated any rigged die at all, so that the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 is whatever they want it to be.\nYou are worried because you always play a game with this friend where you win if you roll something greater than 4, then less than or equal to 4, then greater than 4. So you want to see how the friend’s rigging machine could affect your likelihood of winning.\nWrite a function that computes your likelihood of winning (i.e., your likelihood of getting this sequence of three rolls), for any die with any probability of producing an outcome greater than 4.\nIn this case, you could now take your code and transform it into a function, like\n\ncompute_win_prob &lt;- function(p_greater) {\n    p_less_or_equal &lt;- 1 - p_greater\n    p_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\n    return(p_sequence)\n}\n\nAnd then test it on some values:\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.01)\n\n[1] 9.9e-05\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.5)\n\n[1] 0.125\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.99)\n\n[1] 0.009801\n\n\nThen we could ask you to think about\nWhat value for p_greater do you think would maximize your probability of winning?\nand then\nProduce a plot showing your likelihood of winning for 1000 different values of p_greater, evenly spread between 0 and 1\nand you could use the function you wrote like\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\np_greater_vals &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000)\n#p_greater_vals\nwin_prob_vals &lt;- sapply(p_greater_vals, compute_win_prob)\nwin_df &lt;- tibble(p_greater=p_greater_vals, win_prob=win_prob_vals)\nggplot(win_df, aes(x=p_greater, y=win_prob)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  dsan_theme(\"full\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Probability of Winning With Rigged Die\",\n    x = \"Pr(Result &gt; 4)\",\n    y = \"Pr(Win)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, we could ask you to draw a conclusion about this situation:\nLooking at the plot, approximately what value for the rigged die looks like it produces the maximum likelihood of winning? Now write code to compute the actual value, out of the 1000 evenly-spaced values you computed the win probability for, that maximizes your probability of winning. Does it match your guess from earlier?\nFor which you could write code like\n\nmax_prob &lt;- max(win_df$win_prob)\nmax_row &lt;- win_df %&gt;% filter(win_prob == max_prob)\nmax_row\n\n\n\n\n\np_greater\nwin_prob\n\n\n\n\n0.6666667\n0.1481481\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy point in writing all this out is just to say: that was a whole other way to compute probabilities using a computer, where the focus wasn’t on making a big tibble and then extracting smaller chunks out of it and dividing their sizes. We did have to construct a tibble, in order to compute the win probabilities for a spectrum of values, but that was just so we could generate a plot (since ggplot() needed to know specifically what points to put at what coordinates).\nSo, in this approach, we don’t have a single tibble throughout the entire problem that serves as our sample space. We just use tibbles when we need them, as tools for doing math or making plots, while the probabilities themselves are still getting computed using simple multiplication.\nAnd, I mentioned above how the tibble-subsetting method doesn’t allow us to deal with continuous probability distributions. We’ve now seen, on the other hand, how this “fancy calculator” approach is able to deal with such distributions: we were really looking at the distribution of all possible rigged dice, meaning, the space of all dice with \\(\\Pr(\\text{roll greater than 4}) = p\\) for \\(p \\in [0,1]\\). We had to approximate this continuous space using a grid of 1000 samples, which brought us closer to the fancy-spreadsheet approach, but hopefully this can help make it a bit clearer how the fancy-calculator approach can help us when the fancy-spreadsheet approach can’t, even if it (the fancy-calculator approach) requires us to do a lot more math in our heads."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nThe method used in this proof, if you haven’t seen it before, is called Cantor diagonalization, and it is extremely fun and applicable to a wide variety of levels-of-infinity proofs↩︎\nFor intuition: \\(X \\sim U[0,10] \\implies \\Pr(X = \\pi) = \\frac{|\\{v \\in \\mathbb{R}:\\; v = \\pi\\}|}{|\\mathbb{R}|} = \\frac{1}{2^{\\aleph_0}} \\approx 0\\). That is, finding the \\(\\pi\\) needle in the \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) haystack is a one-in-\\(\\left(\\infty^\\infty\\right)\\) event. A similar issue occurs if \\(S\\) is countably-infinite, like \\(S = \\mathbb{N}\\): \\(\\Pr(X = 3) = \\frac{|\\{x \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\; x = 3\\}|}{|\\mathbb{N}|} = \\frac{1}{\\aleph_0}\\).↩︎\nA fun way to never have to memorize or compute these: imagine a pyramid like \\(\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{\\boxed{\\phantom{1}}}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{\\boxed{\\phantom{1}}}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{\\boxed{\\phantom{1}}}\\), where the boxes are slots for numbers, and put a \\(1\\) in the box at the top. In the bottom row, fill each slot with the sum of the two numbers above-left and above-right of it. Since \\(1 + \\text{(nothing)} = 1\\), this looks like: \\(\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{1}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\). Continue filling in the pyramid this way, so the next row looks like \\(\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{1}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{2}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{1}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\), then \\(\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{1}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{3}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{2}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{3}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{1}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\), and so on. The \\(k\\)th number in the \\(N\\)th row (counting from \\(0\\)) is \\(\\binom{N}{k}\\). For the triangle written out to the 7th row, see Appendix I at end of slideshow.↩︎"

We break the stick at random, we select randomly one of the two pieces, and we break that piece at random.\n\n\n\n\nWill these two interpretations result in the same probabilities?\nIf yes, what is that probability?\nIf no, what are the probabilities in each case?"

    "section": "The Drunkard’s Walk",
    "text": "The Drunkard’s Walk\nIn class today I described one of the many Data Generating Processes that could give rise to normally-distributed data. It involved a simple random walk, where you imagine a person on a numberline at the point \\(x = 0\\), and then imagine them flipping a coin repeatedly: when the coin comes up Tails, they move 1 unit to the left, and when the coin comes up Heads they move 1 unit to the right. This stochastic process can be visualized via the following diagram[^drunkard]:\n\nHere we can think of the “layers” (the vertical columns) in the diagram as representing the branching possibilities in each step: at time \\(t = 0\\), before any coin flips have been carried out, there is only one possible state of the system: the person is at the point \\(x = 0\\).\nAfter a single time step, at time \\(t = 1\\), there are now two possible states of the system: if the (single) coin flip came up Tails the person is at \\(x = -1\\), and if it came up Heads the person is at \\(x = 1\\).\nHopefully some general aspects and mathematical properties of this stochastic process immediately stand out:\n\nThere are two ways we could describe a given state of this system at a time \\(t\\):\n\nFirst, we could describe the history of all choices that led to the current state: the node at the top of the \\(t = 2\\) column, for example, could be represented as a vector \\((L, L)\\), corresponding to the fact that the person ended up at this state by moving left, then moving left again.\nAlternatively, we could choose to only keep track of the person’s position on the number line, dropping the information about their history (how they got there). If we choose this option, the state can be described by a single number: the \\(x\\) coordinate of where the person is located at that time.\nNotice how this second option “collapses” some of the nodes in the diagram down into a single state: for example, the three history vectors \\(()\\) (the vector corresponding to the start node, where no moves have been made yet), \\((L,R)\\) and \\((R,L)\\), which are three different states under the first option, both represent the single state \\(x = 0\\) if we use this option.\n\nThe number of possible states (nodes) at each time step \\(t\\) is just \\(2^t\\). This comes from our multiplication rule from earlier in the semester: if we’re making \\(n\\) choices, where each choice involves choosing between \\(k\\) alternatives, the total number of choice vectors (decisions for all \\(n\\) choices) is \\(k^n\\). Here we’re making \\(t\\) choices (one at each time step), choosing between \\(2\\) alternatives each time (going left vs. going right), giving \\(2^t\\) total choice vectors.\n\nNow that we have an idea of some of the mathematical properties of this system, let’s focus in on converting this into code!\nFirst things first, we make sure to use R’s set.seed() function to ensure reproducibility of our results across different runs of the notebook:\nset.seed(5100)\nYour first intuition might be to create a variable x to keep track of the state, then create a loop that will run N times, updating the state each time through the loop. In data science world, it turns out that this approach is very inefficient (in terms of memory usage but also, more importantly, in terms of the time it will take to run the simulation). But, let’s start with that and work our way towards the more efficient solution.\nFor concreteness, let’s try to simulate a person following this procedure for N = 10 steps, where each coin flip is with a fair coin, with \\(\\Pr(H) = 0.5\\). I am forever infinitely mad about the fact that R does not come with built-in support for the Bernoulli distribution (literally the distribution that every single other possible discrete distribution is built on top of…), so instead of using dbinom() incorrectly like I did in class, I am instead going to import the Rlab library, which adds in functions like dbern(), rbern(), etc., that are bafflingly absent from base-R:\n\nlibrary(Rlab)\nt &lt;- 0\nx &lt;- 0\nwriteLines(paste0(\"Starting state (t = \",t,\"): x = \",x))\nfor (i in seq(from = 1, to = 10)) {\n    writeLines(paste0(\"=====[ Step \",i,\" ]=====\"))\n    # Flip coin\n    flip_outcome &lt;- rbern(1,0.5)\n    writeLines(paste0(\"Coin flip outcome: \",flip_outcome))\n    # Choose direction based on result\n    direction &lt;- \"\"\n    if (flip_outcome == 0) {\n        # Outcome = Tails\n        direction &lt;- \"Left\"\n        x &lt;- x - 1\n    } else {\n        # Outcome = Heads\n        direction &lt;- \"Right\"\n        x &lt;- x + 1\n    }\n    # And increment the time counter\n    t &lt;- t + 1\n    writeLines(paste0(\"Moved \",direction))\n    writeLines(paste0(\"New state (t = \",t,\"): x = \",x))\n}\n\n# # Unique id for each person\n# pid &lt;- seq(1, num_people)\n# pid_tib &lt;- tibble(pid)\n# pos_df &lt;- tibble()\n# end_df &lt;- tibble()\n#   all_steps &lt;- t(replicate(num_people, sample(support, num_steps, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.5))))\n\nRlab 4.0 attached.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'Rlab'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    dexp, dgamma, dweibull, pexp, pgamma, pweibull, qexp, qgamma,\n    qweibull, rexp, rgamma, rweibull\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:datasets':\n\n    precip\n\n\n\n\nStarting state (t = 0): x = 0\n=====[ Step 1 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 1\nMoved Right\nNew state (t = 1): x = 1\n=====[ Step 2 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 2): x = 0\n=====[ Step 3 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 3): x = -1\n=====[ Step 4 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 4): x = -2\n=====[ Step 5 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 1\nMoved Right\nNew state (t = 5): x = -1\n=====[ Step 6 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 6): x = -2\n=====[ Step 7 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 7): x = -3\n=====[ Step 8 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 8): x = -4\n=====[ Step 9 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 0\nMoved Left\nNew state (t = 9): x = -5\n=====[ Step 10 ]=====\nCoin flip outcome: 1\nMoved Right\nNew state (t = 10): x = -4\n\n\nTechnically, this code is sufficient to carry out our whole simulation, if we didn’t care about memory/time considerations. For example, we could use it to write a slow_simulation function, that takes in num_steps as its argument, simulates this many steps of the process, and returns the resulting state. To avoid the function printing out all of the above information 100 times, which will make things run even more slowly, I will also add a verbose argument that is set to FALSE by default. This is good practice in some cases, software-engineering-wise, since if something goes wrong during a call to the function we can re-run the function with verbose set to be TRUE and see the same type of info we printed out above.\n\nslow_simulation &lt;- function(num_steps, verbose = FALSE) {\n    t &lt;- 0\n    x &lt;- 0\n    if (verbose) {\n        writeLines(paste0(\"Starting state (t = \",t,\"): x = \",x))\n    }\n    for (i in 1:num_steps) {\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"=====[ Step \",i,\" ]=====\"))\n        }\n        # Flip coin\n        flip_outcome &lt;- rbern(1,0.5)\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"Coin flip outcome: \",flip_outcome))\n        }\n        # Choose direction based on result\n        direction &lt;- \"\"\n        if (flip_outcome == 0) {\n            # Outcome = Tails\n            direction &lt;- \"Left\"\n            x &lt;- x - 1\n        } else {\n            # Outcome = Heads\n            direction &lt;- \"Right\"\n            x &lt;- x + 1\n        }\n        # And increment the time counter\n        t &lt;- t + 1\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"Moved \",direction))\n            writeLines(paste0(\"New state: x = \",x))\n        }\n    }\n    return(x)\n}\n\nIt is usually good practice, once you’ve written a function like this, to test that it works for the simplest “corner cases” or “base cases”: in this case, for example, we should quickly verify that it always produces the expected output \\(x = 0\\) when we ask it for the result of the process after zero steps:\n\nreplicate(10, slow_simulation(0))\n\n\n00-200-200-2-2\n\n\nAnd alas, we have already found a bug in our implementation! It turns out that, unlike in Python or most other programming languages, using just the colon operator (:) can lead to some terrifying bugs,since if the number after the : is less than the number before the :, R will just start iterating backwards from the first number down to the second number:\n\n5:-3\n\n\n543210-1-2-3\n\n\nThis may seem inocuous, until you try to write a function like this which loops a specific number of times, and you try to support the case of running zero times. For example, if you use 1:n, and you accept n as an argument to your function, you’ll get a case like the following:\n\nn &lt;- 0\n1:n\n\n\n10\n\n\nThe takeaway is: if we want to be fully careful, and we want to make sure our function also produces the correct answer for zero steps, then we need to use R’s seq_len() function! seq_len(N) can be used in a loop to ensure that R loops over a sequence from 1 to N, and always counts up, so we avoid this case:\n\nslow_simulation &lt;- function(num_steps, verbose = FALSE) {\n    t &lt;- 0\n    x &lt;- 0\n    if (verbose) {\n        writeLines(paste0(\"Starting state (t = \",t,\"): x = \",x))\n    }\n    for (i in seq_len(num_steps)) {\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"=====[ Step \",i,\" ]=====\"))\n        }\n        # Flip coin\n        flip_outcome &lt;- rbern(1,0.5)\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"Coin flip outcome: \",flip_outcome))\n        }\n        # Choose direction based on result\n        direction &lt;- \"\"\n        if (flip_outcome == 0) {\n            # Outcome = Tails\n            direction &lt;- \"Left\"\n            x &lt;- x - 1\n        } else {\n            # Outcome = Heads\n            direction &lt;- \"Right\"\n            x &lt;- x + 1\n        }\n        # And increment the time counter\n        t &lt;- t + 1\n        if (verbose) {\n            writeLines(paste0(\"Moved \",direction))\n            writeLines(paste0(\"New state: x = \",x))\n        }\n    }\n    return(x)\n}\n\nRe-running our tests, to make sure it works as expected now even in the N = 0 case, we get:\n\nreplicate(10, slow_simulation(0))\n\n\n0000000000\n\n\nThere may still be issues, but now let’s use this function to find the state of the system after N = 100 steps (we’ll run it 3 times here, just to show how it can produces different outcomes each time it is re-run)\n\nslow_simulation(100)\n\n6\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(100)\n\n-20\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(100)\n\n-6\n\n\nAnd we see that, repeating the process 4 times, the random-walker ended up at \\(x = -20\\), \\(x = 2\\), and \\(x = -2\\) after 100 steps. From this (or from intuition from the diagram, or from thinking about the process in general), we could infer another fact: that the random-walker will end up at an even-numbered coordinate if they take an even number of steps (including 0 steps). By similar reasoning, if we run the process for an odd number of steps, the random-walker will end up on an odd-numbered coordinate (here we run for a few even and odd values, so you can start to see this general pattern):\n\nslow_simulation(7)\n\n1\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(8)\n\n2\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(9)\n\n1\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(11)\n\n-1\n\n\n\nslow_simulation(13)\n\n1\n\n\nHere we have to pause, because we have to take into account the fact that we really want to simulate this process for a large number of people, and a large number of steps, so that this loop-based approach is going to become super slow and unwieldy as we increase the number of people/steps.\nSo, let’s think about how we could speed it up. Honestly, this can often be more of an art than a science, but it is genuinely so important, as it can mean the difference between your code finishing in a few seconds and finishing in a few hours.\nFor this problem, there are a number of ways you could arrive at a faster, more efficient approach, but for the sake of brevity I will cut to the chase and just mention that a key property we can use here is the fact that the outcome after N steps, regardless of how big N is, is really just a sum of independently-generated 0/1 variables!\nWe could derive this insight, for example, by recalling the above discussion about the two different ways to store the state of the system (storing just the value of \\(x\\) vs. storing the entire history), and thinking about the relationship between these two representations:\n\nIf we know the entire history of a random-walker, we could use that information to figure out their position, by just starting from \\(x = 0\\) and following each of the steps recorded in their history vector.\nThe converse isn’t true, though: if we know that the random-walker is at \\(x = 0\\), we cannot infer (at least, cannot infer with certainty) the history of states that led them to end up at that coordinate. As we already saw just in considering two time steps, for example, they could have arrived at \\(x = 0\\) via the histories \\(()\\), \\((L,R)\\), or \\((R,L)\\).\n\nThis insight becomes especially helpful if we think about how we could encode what we’re currently writing as \\(R\\) or \\(L\\) in a more helpful way: leaping once again over lots of thinking about it, if we chose to instead encode a move left as the number \\(-1\\), and a move right as the number \\(1\\), suddenly we may be able to see the relationship between the full-history state space and the “collapsed” state space where we just keep track of \\(x\\). We can write out some histories using this \\(-1\\) or \\(1\\) representation, then look at the \\(x\\) value these histories produce, and try to see the pattern:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory vector(original)\nHistory vector(numeric representation)\nResulting values of \\(x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(()\\)\n\\(()\\)\n\\(x = 0\\)\n\n\n\\((L,L,R)\\)\n\\((-1, -1, 1)\\)\n\\(x = -1\\)\n\n\n\\((L,R)\\)\n\\((-1,1)\\)\n\\(x = 0\\)\n\n\n\\((R,R,R,R)\\)\n\\((1,1,1,1)\\)\n\\(x = 4\\)\n\n\n\\((R,L,R,L,R,L)\\)\n\\((1,-1,1,-1,1,-1)\\)\n\\(x = 0\\)\n\n\n\nDo you see the pattern? Jumping to the punchline: by using the numeric representation of the history vector, we can immediately derive the final position of the random-walker by summing up the values of their history vector in this representation!\nIf it’s still unclear why this is helpful, that’s ok: it may be an appreciation that only comes from spending hours debugging hundreds of tiny little errors in C code that your professor/boss has asked you to optimize down to the individual-bits-of-RAM level 😛 But it will hopefully become a little more clear regardless once we compare the runtimes of our two approaches!\nLet’s use this sum-to-get-final-state insight to rewrite our code without any loops. The main thing left to figure out is: how to generate a sequence of random values drawn uniformly from \\(\\{-1, 1\\}\\)? We could approach this using the discrete uniform distribution, or we could approach this by transforming the Bernoulli distribution (which produces values in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)) in a smart way. But, optimizing for laziness, we can do even less work: there is already a name for this distribution (of a random variable \\(X\\) with equally-likely outcomes drawn from the support set \\(\\mathcal{R}_X = \\{-1,1\\}\\)): it’s called the Rademacher Distribution.\nAs with the Bernoulli distribution, base-R does not have a built-in function for generating random Rademacher-distributed variables, so instead we can use an implementation provided by the extraDistr library, a function named rsign() (since you can think about this distribution as determining a random sign: positive or negative). Let’s use rsign() to rewrite our function so it just\n\nGenerates num_steps random numbers, each one representing a piece of the history vector, and then\nSums them to get our resulting \\(x\\) value\n\n\n# (Uncomment and run the following line if you\n# don't have the extraDistr library installed)\n#install.packages(\"extraDistr\")\n\n\nlibrary(extraDistr)\nfaster_simulation &lt;- function(num_steps, verbose = FALSE) {\n    # Generate a history vector with length `num_steps`,\n    # in the representation where every step is a coin\n    # flip, but we record -1 for tails and 1 for heads\n    history_vec &lt;- rsign(num_steps)\n    final_x &lt;- sum(history_vec)\n    return(final_x)\n}\n\n\nAttaching package: 'extraDistr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:Rlab':\n\n    dbern, pbern, qbern, rbern\n\n\n\n\nAnd now let’s check that it works for the corner case we identified above:\n\nreplicate(10,faster_simulation(0))\n\n\n0000000000\n\n\nAnd check that the values it generates still seem right, for non-corner-case values:\n\nfaster_simulation(100)\n\n2\n\n\n\nfaster_simulation(100)\n\n20\n\n\n\nfaster_simulation(100)\n\n12"

There are a few ways to measure the time that it takes for R functions to run, but to me the easiest way (and you want it to be easy when you’re spending hours and hours just trying to tweak the runtime of one function) is to use the tictoc library (not part of base-R): once you load this library using library(tictoc), you literally just put tic() somewhere in your code, then toc() somewhere afterwards, and it measures the time that elapsed in between these two function calls:\n\n# (Uncomment to install, if needed)\n#install.packages(\"tictoc\")\n\n\nlibrary(tictoc)\ntic()\n1 + 1\ntoc()\n\n2\n\n\n0.001 sec elapsed\n\n\nSo, let’s use this library to measure how long it takes the two approaches to simulate 1 million steps of the process (for one person):\n\nsteps_to_simulate &lt;- 1000000\n\n\n# Our first attempt\ntic()\nslow_simulation(steps_to_simulate)\nslow_sim_times &lt;- toc()\nslow_sim_elapsed &lt;- as.numeric(slow_sim_times$toc - slow_sim_times$tic)\nslow_sim_elapsed\n\n2150\n\n\n1.603 sec elapsed\n\n\n1.603\n\n\n\ntic()\nfaster_simulation(steps_to_simulate)\nfast_sim_times &lt;- toc()\nfast_sim_elapsed &lt;- as.numeric(fast_sim_times$toc - fast_sim_times$tic)\nfast_sim_elapsed\n\n-98\n\n\n0.008 sec elapsed\n\n\n0.00800000000000001\n\n\nBy dividing the elapsed times for the two approaches (which we’ll be able to interpret since these are ratio variables 😉):\n\nelapsed_ratio &lt;- slow_sim_elapsed / fast_sim_elapsed\nelapsed_ratio\n\n200.375\n\n\nWe can see that, already (just for one person), the improved version using sum() runs 128 times faster than our original approach using a for loop 😳\nWe could optimize the move to multiple people even more, but even if we just keep the two implementations as they currently are, and use replicate() to repeat them 10 times (i.e., generate history vectors and results for 10 people instead of 1), the efficiency difference becomes even more pronounced:\n\nnum_people &lt;- 10\n\n\n# Our first attempt, now for 10 people\ntic()\nreplicate(num_people, slow_simulation(steps_to_simulate))\nslow_sim_times &lt;- toc()\nslow_sim_elapsed &lt;- as.numeric(slow_sim_times$toc - slow_sim_times$tic)\nslow_sim_elapsed\n\n\n-220482-1626-308390952-1410-14781180-548\n\n\n15.27 sec elapsed\n\n\n15.27\n\n\n\ntic()\nreplicate(num_people, faster_simulation(steps_to_simulate))\nfast_sim_times &lt;- toc()\nfast_sim_elapsed &lt;- as.numeric(fast_sim_times$toc - fast_sim_times$tic)\nfast_sim_elapsed\n\n\n-3789121174-688-1264360-2514-298-3421208\n\n\n0.077 sec elapsed\n\n\n0.0769999999999982\n\n\nWe now, in both cases, have simulated data for 10 people performing this random walk procedure, both equally valid in terms of our use to simulate [one of] the data-generating process[es] underlying the Normal Distribution.

It’s our old friend the “bell curve”!

    "text": "Applying Transformations to x_T\nIt may have seemed like overkill to take the length-1000000 vector we had and convert it into a 1000000-row tibble, since we only had one column. But now let’s see why we did this: let’s take this column of the raw (simulated) values of \\(x_T\\) and use it to derive simulated values of functions of \\(x_T\\).\nFor example, instead of analyzing the positions, perhaps in the context of our problem we only care about how far away the people end up from their starting point. In that case, what we really care about is not \\(x\\) itself but \\(|x - 0| = |x|\\), the absolute distance (on the numberline) of the person’s final position from their starting position.\nNow that you’ve seen how changing from a for-loop-based approach to a “vectorized” approach can vastly improve efficiency, I also want you to move your focus away from how these absolute distances could be computed using a loop and instead focus on how they could be computed using a mathematical function that could be applied to an entire vector of data (in this case, the vector that we get by pulling the x_T column out of the tibble). In this case hopefully this mathematical operation is clear: we just want to apply the absolute value function to the x_T column vector. So, here let’s use the mutate() function from dplyr (part of the tidyverse) to create a new column in our tibble called abs_dist, computed on the basis of x_T and representing this absolute distance:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nx_tibble &lt;- x_tibble |&gt; mutate(abs_dist = abs(x_T))\nx_tibble |&gt; head()\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:Rlab':\n\n    count\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\n\n\n\nA tibble: 6 x 3\n\n\nobs_id\nx_T\nabs_dist\n\n\n&lt;int&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n1\n54\n54\n\n\n2\n22\n22\n\n\n3\n-8\n8\n\n\n4\n40\n40\n\n\n5\n-4\n4\n\n\n6\n-18\n18\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we see that, at least in the first six columns, our “pipeline” has successfully taken the absolute values of the x_T column: -42 has been transformed to 42, -70 to 70, and so on.\nNow, just as we did above, we can plot the distribution of this data, which is not the “raw” (simulated) data but a function of the raw data, which forms its own distribution that may be different from the distribution of the original data:\n\nggplot(x_tibble, aes(x = abs_dist)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=6) +\n  dsan_theme()\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve plotted two distributions using the geom_histogram() function from the ggplot2 library, it’s probably a good time to also mention how (like the warning messages from ggplot2 will try to warn you) histograms can sometimes be more misleading than helpful when it comes to understanding your data: skipping over lots of details2, the way that the hisogram looks depends a good amount on the bin width or number of bins parameter, so that (a) it’s good to examine the histogram of the distribution under many different choices for this bin width/number of bins, but also (b) it’s good to check what the kernel density plot of the distribution looks like, as an alternative to the histogram:\n\nggplot(x_tibble, aes(x = abs_dist)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  dsan_theme()\n\n\n\n\nThe kernel density plot’s bandwidth parameter can be tweaked to make the plot look different, just like the binwidth parameter of geom_histogram() can be tweaked to make the histogram look different, but in my experience geom_density() tends to require less tweaking: it usually produces the distribution that I’m expecting to see (if I already know what the distribution should look like), so that I trust it a bit more to give a reasonably accurate “picture” of the distribution of data that I haven’t seen before.\nThis distribution, just like the Normal and Rademacher distributions we’ve seen so far, has a name! It is called the Folded Normal Distribution, if you’d like to learn how that works."

And, again using code similar to that used above, let’s look at the distribution of this new variable by plotting a histogram:\n\nggplot(x_tibble, aes(x = sq_dist)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  dsan_theme()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(x_tibble, aes(x = sq_dist)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  dsan_theme()\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, just like in the absolute value case, this distribution has a name, and is far more common than the folded distribution: the Chi-Squared (\\(\\chi^2\\)) Distribution. We’ll learn more about this distribution soon."

    "section": "Row-Wise Operations in tidyverse",
    "text": "Row-Wise Operations in tidyverse\nIn terms of what you have to do to complete Lab 4, this is probably the most important thing to know about tidyverse functions, especially those in dplyr: they are not as easy to use row-wise as the base-R functions are!\nWe just saw how “naturally” the tidyverse functions allow us to compute new columns by applying a unary transformation (like abs() or ^2) to one previously-existing column. But, if you want to compute a new column by applying an arbitrary function to two or more columns of your tibble at a time, you have to use the tidyverse construct rowwise(), and (frustratingly) not all transformation functions work well with this rowwise() operator.\nTo see what I mean, let’s go back to our simulation function from above and generate another column x2_T, containing the results from running the random walk 1000 steps for 1 million simulated people again:\n\nx2_T_vals &lt;- replicate(N, faster_simulation(T))\nx_tibble &lt;- x_tibble %&gt;% mutate(x2_T = x2_T_vals)\nx_tibble |&gt; head()\n\n\nA tibble: 6 x 5\n\n\nobs_id\nx_T\nabs_dist\nsq_dist\nx2_T\n\n\n&lt;int&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n1\n54\n54\n2916\n-10\n\n\n2\n22\n22\n484\n-2\n\n\n3\n-8\n8\n64\n52\n\n\n4\n40\n40\n1600\n62\n\n\n5\n-4\n4\n16\n-14\n\n\n6\n-18\n18\n324\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now let’s assume we are interested in the maximum of these two values for a given person: intuitively, we might think we could just write max(x_T, x2_T) and it should work out, but let’s see what happens when we try this using tidyverse functions:\n\nx_tibble &lt;- x_tibble |&gt; mutate(x_max = max(x_T, x2_T))\nx_tibble |&gt; head()\n\n\nA tibble: 6 x 6\n\n\nobs_id\nx_T\nabs_dist\nsq_dist\nx2_T\nx_max\n\n\n&lt;int&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n1\n54\n54\n2916\n-10\n156\n\n\n2\n22\n22\n484\n-2\n156\n\n\n3\n-8\n8\n64\n52\n156\n\n\n4\n40\n40\n1600\n62\n156\n\n\n5\n-4\n4\n16\n-14\n156\n\n\n6\n-18\n18\n324\n6\n156\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething has gone horribly wrong, right? Every single value is the same, and this value doesn’t seem to correspond to any of the x2 values in the first six rows of the tibble.\nWhat happened is: R interpreted the expression max(x_T, x2_T) as saying “find the maximum value across both of these two vectors I’m giving you”, so it found that maximum value (156 in this case), and then the call to the mutate() function was interpreted in turn by tidyverse as you telling it to “create a new column called x_max and store the number 156 in it, in every slot”.\nTo further confirm what happened, we can actually go and find the row that led it to produce the number 156:\n\nx_tibble |&gt; filter((x_T == 156) | (x2_T == 156))\n\n\nA tibble: 1 x 6\n\n\nobs_id\nx_T\nabs_dist\nsq_dist\nx2_T\nx_max\n\n\n&lt;int&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n60249\n-30\n30\n900\n156\n156\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we see that participant number 60249 in our simulation indeed ended up at \\(x = -30\\) on their first run, but then at \\(x = 156\\) on their second run, the furthest to the right that anyone in the dataset ended up.\nTo properly compute the max of the values in a row (or some subset of the values, like we want in this case), we have to add the rowwise() transformation into our pipeline right before we use the mutate() function. This will then let the mutate() function know that, when we say max(), we mean the maximum over the specified values within each row, not across the entire dataset. So, redoing the above code with rowwise() added in looks like:\n\nx_tibble &lt;- x_tibble |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(x_max = max(x_T, x2_T))\nx_tibble |&gt; head()\n\n\nA rowwise_df: 6 x 6\n\n\nobs_id\nx_T\nabs_dist\nsq_dist\nx2_T\nx_max\n\n\n&lt;int&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n1\n54\n54\n2916\n-10\n54\n\n\n2\n22\n22\n484\n-2\n22\n\n\n3\n-8\n8\n64\n52\n52\n\n\n4\n40\n40\n1600\n62\n62\n\n\n5\n-4\n4\n16\n-14\n-4\n\n\n6\n-18\n18\n324\n6\n6\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we can breathe a sigh of relief: the max() function used within mutate() has now been interpreted as we wanted: as a rowwise maximum, so that the value in the x_max column now represents that individual’s highest x_T value. And, we can take a look at the distribution of this maximum value, seeing whether (for example) it is still normal or whether it takes on the shape of some other known distribution:\n\nggplot(x_tibble, aes(x = x_max)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  dsan_theme()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd using the kernel density geometry instead:\n\nggplot(x_tibble, aes(x = x_max)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\nThis time, the data does look approximately normal. I will leave it to you all (just like on Lab 4) to interpret why this may be the case! (Or whether it’s the case at all…) But if you are stuck just let me know / come to my office hours, and I’m happy to help you think more about this max() transformation!"

    "section": "Deeper Dive",
    "text": "Deeper Dive\nBut now let’s think about what’s behind this… It’s a dangerous, highly contagious disease, meaning that (societally) false negatives are much, much worse than false positives:\n\nA false negative, in this case, means that someone is walking around thinking they don’t have the disease (because they tested negative), when they actually do. This means that they are not quarantining, they are going out to parties and events and etc., spreading the disease.\nA false positive, on the other hand, means someone who panics unnecessarily: maybe it means, they go to the hospital, the hospital performs additional tests, and successfully discovers that the person, despite their positive test result, doesn’t have the disease.\nSo, consequence-wise, a false negative potentially means a new outbreak of the disease in the society, while a false positive means a quick (scary, but hopefully quick) trip to the hospital\n\n\nThe Catastrophic Case\nSo, let’s focus on the disastrous first case: what’s the probability of a false negative? First, we can compute the conditional probability of a negative test, conditional on someone having the disease? Here we just use our complement rule of probability: that \\(\\Pr(E^c) = 1 - \\Pr(E)\\) for any event \\(E\\):\n\\[\n\\Pr(T = 0 \\mid D = 1) = 1 - \\Pr(T = 1 \\mid D = 1) = 0.01\n\\]\nNow that we know this, let’s incorporate the base rate information—that is, the information we have about the likelihood of having the disease (the thing we conditioned on above):\n\\[\n\\Pr(D = 1) = \\frac{1}{10000}\n\\]\nSo, given these two pieces of information, we can compute the probability of a person in the population being a false negative case: having the disease, but not being detected by the test.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(T = 0 \\cap D = 1) &= \\Pr(T = 0 \\mid D = 1)\\Pr(D = 1) \\\\\n&= (0.01)(1/10000) = \\frac{1}{1000000},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\ni.e., one in a million.\n\n\nThe Bad (But Not Catastrophic) Case\nNow let’s turn to the second, bad but not catastrophic, case: the probability of a false positive. As before, we start by computing the conditional probability of a positive test result for someone who in fact does not have the disease:\n\\[\n\\Pr(T = 1 \\mid D = 0) = 1 - \\Pr(T = 0 \\mid D = 0) = 0.01\n\\]\nThis time, however, we’ll see that the base rate will make a big difference. The base rate in this case—the probability of someone not having the disease—is:\n\\[\n\\Pr(D = 0) = 1 - \\Pr(D = 1) = \\frac{9999}{10000}\n\\]\nSo, incorporating these two pieces of information, we can compute the likelihood of a false positive case: someone in the population who doesn’t have the disease but does test positive:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(T = 1 \\cap D = 0) &= \\Pr(T = 1 \\mid D = 0)\\Pr(D = 0) \\\\\n&= (0.01)(9999/10000) = \\frac{9999}{1000000}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIn words: for every million people in the population, 9999 of them will have a false positive panic: they won’t have the disease, but they will think they have the disease because of their positive test."
