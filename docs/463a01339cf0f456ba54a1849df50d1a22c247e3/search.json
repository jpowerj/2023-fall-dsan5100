    "text": "Proposition \\(p\\): A true-false statement like “1 + 1 = 2” or “\\(x\\) is greater than 5”. The latter would be written as \\(p(x)\\), since its true/false value depends on a given value of \\(x\\).\n\\(\\wedge\\): Logical “and”. \\(p \\wedge q\\) is true only if both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are true.\n\\(\\vee\\): Logical “or”. \\(p \\vee q\\) is true if \\(p\\) is true or \\(q\\) is true, or both are true.\n\\(\\neg\\): Logical negation: If \\(p\\) is true, \\(\\neg p\\) is false. If \\(p\\) is false, \\(\\neg p\\) is true.\nDeMorgan’s Laws: Logical identities which illustrate how the negation operator gets “distributed” in a logical statement, allowing conversion of “or” statements into “and” statements, and vice-versa: \\(\\neg(p \\wedge q) = \\neg(\\neg p \\vee \\neg q)\\)\n\\(\\implies\\): “Implies”. \\(a \\implies b\\) is true if, whenever \\(a\\) is true, \\(b\\) is also true.\n\\(\\iff\\): “If and only if”. \\(a \\iff b\\) is true if, \\(a\\) is only true when \\(b\\) is true, and \\(a\\) is only false when \\(b\\) is false.\n\\(\\exists\\): “There exists”. In the course this will be written as \\(\\exists x \\in S [p(x)]\\), which means that there exists some element \\(x\\) in the set \\(S\\) such that \\(p(x)\\) is true. Also called the “existential quantifier”.\n\\(\\forall\\): “For all”. In the course this will be written as \\(\\forall x \\in S [p(x)]\\), which means that for every element in a set \\(S\\) (with \\(x\\) representing some element arbitrarily taken from \\(S\\)), the proposition \\(p(x)\\) is true. Also called the “universal quantifier”.\n\nNote that the universal and existential quantifiers are closely related by a negation law (just like \\(\\wedge\\) and \\(\\vee\\) and their connection via DeMorgan’s Laws): \\(\\neg \\left( \\forall x \\in S[p(x)] \\right) \\iff \\exists x \\in S [\\neg p(x)]\\). The negation on the outside of the quantified proposition has moved inside of it, with the quantifier flipped.\nThe same holds true in reverse: \\(\\neg \\left( \\exists x \\in S [p(x)] \\right) \\iff \\forall x \\in S [\\neg p(x)]\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA set \\(S\\) (denoted by a capital letter when possible) is a collection of elements (denoted by a lowercase letter when possible).\n\nFor example, if \\(S = \\{0,1,2,3\\}\\), then \\(0\\) is an element of \\(S\\).\n\n\\(a \\in S\\): The proposition that \\(a\\) is an element of the set \\(S\\).\n\nIf \\(S = \\{0,1,2,3\\}\\), then \\(2 \\in S\\) but \\(5 \\notin S\\).\n\n\\(A \\subseteq S\\): The proposition that \\(A\\) is a subset of the set \\(S\\).\n\nIf \\(S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\), then \\(\\{1,3\\} \\subseteq S\\) but \\(\\{1,4\\} \\not\\subseteq S\\). Note that sets are defined to be subsets of themselves, so that \\(S \\subseteq S\\).\n\n\\(A \\subset S\\): The proposition that \\(A\\) is a proper subset of \\(S\\), meaning that \\(A \\subseteq S\\) but \\(A \\neq S\\).\n\nWhile sets are subsets of themselves, sets are not proper subsets of themselves, so that if \\(S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}\\), then \\(\\{1,2,3\\} \\subset S\\) but \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} \\not\\subset S\\).\n\n\\(|S|\\): The cardinality of, or number of elements in, a set \\(S\\).\n\nIf \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\), \\(|S| = 3\\).\nIf the set \\(S\\) has infinite cardinality, we can distinguish between two cases:\n\nIf elements of \\(S\\) can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), we say that \\(S\\) is countably infinite and has cardinality \\(\\aleph_0\\) (pronounced “aleph-null”): \\(|S| = \\aleph_0\\).\nIf elements of \\(S\\) cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), we say that \\(S\\) is uncountably infinite and has cardinality greater than \\(\\aleph_0\\): \\(|S| &gt; \\aleph_0\\).\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(S)\\): The power set of a set \\(S\\), which is the set of all possible subsets of \\(S\\).\n\nFor example, if \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\), \\(\\mathcal{P}(S) = \\{\\varnothing, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{2,3\\}, \\{1,2,3\\}\\}\\). Notice that \\(|\\mathcal{P}(S)| = 2^{|S|}\\), which is always true of the power set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbb{N}\\): The set of all natural numbers, sometimes called the “counting numbers”: \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\}\\) (This set is countably infinite).\n\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\): The set of all integers, which includes all of the natural numbers along with their negatives: \\(\\{\\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}\\) (This set is also countably infinite)\n\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\): The set of all rational numbers, i.e., well-defined ratios of two integers. \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\iff x = \\frac{p}{q}\\) for two integers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), and \\(q \\neq 0\\). (This set is, surprisingly, also countably infinite)\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\): The set of all real numbers, which includes all integers as well as numbers such as \\(\\pi\\), \\(2.356\\), or \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) (This set is uncountably infinite).\nScalar: A single number from some set of numbers, like \\(-2.1 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\)\nVector: A \\(d\\)-dimensional vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is a collection of \\(d\\) scalars in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_d)^\\top\\), which we can interpret as an arrow pointing \\(v_i\\) units in each dimension \\(i\\). For example, if \\(\\mathbf{v} = (3,5)\\), we can interpret \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) as representing an arrow pointing \\(3\\) units in the \\(x\\) direction and \\(5\\) units in the \\(y\\) direction.\n\nAs indicated above, however, we will assume that vectors are column vectors unless otherwise specified, though they will be written row-wise with a transpose symbol at the end. This means that, although it will be written like \\(\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n)^\\top\\), you should apply the transpose in your head: \\[\n\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n)^\\top = \\begin{bmatrix}v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nMatrix: An \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}_{[m \\times n]}\\) is an \\(m\\)-by-\\(n\\) grid of scalars, where the scalar in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column is denoted \\(m_{i,j}\\). In the class, we will be careful to add a subscript like \\(\\mathbf{M}_{[m \\times n]}\\) to indicate the number of rows (\\(m\\)) and columns (\\(n\\)) in the matrix, since operations like multiplication are only defined for matrices with particular dimensions.\nMatrix multiplication: For two matrices \\(\\mathbf{X}_{[a \\times b]}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{[c \\times d]}\\), matrix multiplication is defined if \\(b = c\\), and produces the following \\(a \\times d\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{XY}_{[a \\times d]}\\):\n\\[\n  \\mathbf{XY}_{[a \\times d]} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  x_{1,1}y_{1,1} & \\cdots & x_{m,1}y_{1,n} \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  x_{1,n}y_{m,1} & \\cdots & x_{m,n}y_{m,n}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n f(i)\\): \\(\\Sigma\\) is the capitalized Greek letter “Sigma”, and stands for “Sum” in this case. This notation means: “the sum of \\(f(i)\\) from \\(i = 1\\) to \\(i = n\\)”. For example, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^3 i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14\\).\n\\(\\prod_{i=1}^n f(i)\\): \\(\\Pi\\) is the capitalized Greek letter “Pi”, and stands for “Product” in this case. This notation means: “the product of \\(f(i)\\) from \\(i = 1\\) to \\(i = n\\)”. For example, \\(\\prod_{i=1}^3 i^2 = 1^2 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 36\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\\([a,b] \\in \\mathbb{R}\\): The closed interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) containing all numbers between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), including \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) themselves.\n\\((a,b) \\in \\mathbb{R}\\): The open interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) containing all numbers between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), excluding \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) themselves.\n\\([a, b)\\), \\((a, b]\\): The half-open interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In the first case, we include \\(a\\) but exclude \\(b\\), while in the second we exclude \\(a\\) but include \\(b\\).\n\\(\\int_{a}^b f(x)dx\\): The integral of the function \\(f(x)\\) between points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In this course, you just need to remember that this produces the area under the curve of \\(f(x)\\) between these points.\n\\(\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ f(x) \\right]\\): The derivative of the function \\(f(x)\\). For this class, you just need to remember that the derivative is what transforms a Cumulative Density Function (CDF) into a Probability Density Function (PDF): if \\(F_X(v)\\) is the CDF of a random variable \\(X\\), then \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[ F_X(v) \\right] = f_X(v)\\), the PDF of \\(X\\).\n\nFor functions of multiple variables, like the joint pdf \\(f_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\), we use the \\(\\partial\\) symbol instead of \\(d\\) to denote partial derivatives: for example, the change in \\(F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\) as \\(v_X\\) changes is denoted \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_X}\\left[ F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y) \\right]\\), while the change in \\(F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\) as \\(v_Y\\) changes is denoted \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_Y}\\left[ F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y) \\right]\\)."

    "text": "Deeper Dive\nBut now let’s think about what’s behind this… It’s a dangerous, highly contagious disease, meaning that (societally) false negatives are much, much worse than false positives:\n\nA false negative, in this case, means that someone is walking around thinking they don’t have the disease (because they tested negative), when they actually do. This means that they are not quarantining, they are going out to parties and events and etc., spreading the disease.\nA false positive, on the other hand, means someone who panics unnecessarily: maybe it means, they go to the hospital, the hospital performs additional tests, and successfully discovers that the person, despite their positive test result, doesn’t have the disease.\nSo, consequence-wise, a false negative potentially means a new outbreak of the disease in the society, while a false positive means a quick (scary, but hopefully quick) trip to the hospital\n\n\nThe Catastrophic Case\nSo, let’s focus on the disastrous first case: what’s the probability of a false negative? First, we can compute the conditional probability of a negative test, conditional on someone having the disease? Here we just use our complement rule of probability: that \\(\\Pr(E^c) = 1 - \\Pr(E)\\) for any event \\(E\\):\n\\[\n\\Pr(T = 0 \\mid D = 1) = 1 - \\Pr(T = 1 \\mid D = 1) = 0.01\n\\]\nNow that we know this, let’s incorporate the base rate information—that is, the information we have about the likelihood of having the disease (the thing we conditioned on above):\n\\[\n\\Pr(D = 1) = \\frac{1}{10000}\n\\]\nSo, given these two pieces of information, we can compute the probability of a person in the population being a false negative case: having the disease, but not being detected by the test.\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(T = 0 \\cap D = 1) &= \\Pr(T = 0 \\mid D = 1)\\Pr(D = 1) \\\\\n&= (0.01)(1/10000) = \\frac{1}{1000000},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\ni.e., one in a million.\n\n\nThe Bad (But Not Catastrophic) Case\nNow let’s turn to the second, bad but not catastrophic, case: the probability of a false positive. As before, we start by computing the conditional probability of a positive test result for someone who in fact does not have the disease:\n\\[\n\\Pr(T = 1 \\mid D = 0) = 1 - \\Pr(T = 0 \\mid D = 0) = 0.01\n\\]\nThis time, however, we’ll see that the base rate will make a big difference. The base rate in this case—the probability of someone not having the disease—is:\n\\[\n\\Pr(D = 0) = 1 - \\Pr(D = 1) = \\frac{9999}{10000}\n\\]\nSo, incorporating these two pieces of information, we can compute the likelihood of a false positive case: someone in the population who doesn’t have the disease but does test positive:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(T = 1 \\cap D = 0) &= \\Pr(T = 1 \\mid D = 0)\\Pr(D = 0) \\\\\n&= (0.01)(9999/10000) = \\frac{9999}{1000000}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nIn words: for every million people in the population, 9999 of them will have a false positive panic: they won’t have the disease, but they will think they have the disease because of their positive test."

We’re forcing thousands of people to panic, thinking that they have the disease, when they really don’t!”\nBut, walking through it with this false negative / false positive paradigm, we see the real takeaway: that there is always a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives. In this case, from a public health perspective for example, it’s actually somewhat of a good situation: at the “cost” of having several thousand people panic unnecessarily, we achieve the benefit of making it very, very unlikely (one in a million, literally) that someone goes undetected in the population with this dangerous, contagious disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(N = 1000000\\)\nTrue State of the World\n\n\n\\(D = 0\\)\n(Doesn't have disease)\n\\(D = 1\\)\n(Has disease)\n\n\n\n\nPrediction\n\\(T = 0\\)\n(Tested negative)\nTrue Negative\nSuccessfully detected no disease 👍\n989,901 People\nFalse Negative\nFailed to detect disease 🚨😵🚨\n1 Person\n\n\n\\(T = 1\\)\n(Tested positive)\nFalse Positive\nFalse alarm 😬 sorry!\n9999 People\nTrue Positive\nSuccessfully detected disease 😮‍💨\n99 People\n\n\n\n\n(Compuation of the remaining two cells:)\nTrue Positive:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(T = 1 \\cap D = 1) &= \\Pr(T = 1 \\mid D = 1)\\Pr(D = 1) \\\\\n&= (0.99)\\frac{1}{10000} = \\frac{99}{1000000}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nTrue Negative:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(T = 0 \\cap D = 0) &= \\Pr(T = 0 \\mid D = 0)\\Pr(D = 0) \\\\\n&= (0.99)\\frac{9999}{10000} = \\frac{989901}{1000000}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]"

So, if we’re modeling dice, it makes sense to say e.g. “result is 6” + “result is 3” = “total is 9”. More on the next page!"

What is the probability that an entity in this dataset had a GDP lower than $10 billion, and a country code containing the letter Z, in this year?\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\ngdp_df &lt;- read_csv(\"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jpowerj/fecd437b96d0954893de727383f2eaf2/raw/fec58507f7095cb8341b229d6eb74ce53232d663/gdp_2010.csv\")\nbelow_10b_df &lt;- gdp_df %&gt;% filter(value &lt; 10000000000)\nbelow_10b_z_df &lt;- below_10b_df %&gt;% filter(str_detect(code, 'Z'))\nbelow_10b_z_df\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ncode\nyear\nvalue\n\n\n\n\nBelize\nBLZ\n2010\n1397113450\n\n\nKyrgyz Republic\nKGZ\n2010\n4794357795\n\n\nSwaziland\nSWZ\n2010\n4438778424\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo that now we could compute the probability of a country having these properties:\n\np_event &lt;- nrow(below_10b_z_df) / nrow(gdp_df)\np_event\n\n[1] 0.01470588\n\n\nSo, this approach works well when we’re dealing with nice, simple, finite sample-spacing and outcomes which are easily definable using and or or (for example), but we won’t be able to use it to handle fancier cases like continuous probability distributions."

    "section": "Approach 2: Using R Like a Fancy Calculator",
    "text": "Approach 2: Using R Like a Fancy Calculator\nIn this approach, we basically just use R (or Python, or whatever else) as a glorified calculator. We take the hard part—reasoning about what the sample space might look like, for example, or whether events are independent—and do it in our heads, then use R to figure out what happens when we multiply/add/divide the things we already figured out.\nContinuing the dice example, for instance, this approach would go something like: we ask you\n\nWhat is the probability that you observe a roll greater than 4, followed by a roll less than or equal to 4, followed by a roll greater than 4?\n\nand you reason through this like,\n\nI already know that there are 6 outcomes, and that they’re all equally likely, so that the probability of seeing a particular outcome in \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) is always \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). Therefore I can define an event \\(E_&gt;\\) representing the event of observing an outcome greater than 4, and another event \\(E_\\leq\\) of observing an outcome less than or equal to 4. I know that\n\n\n\nSince the possible outcomes greater than 4 are 5 and 6, my event \\(E_&gt; = \\{5, 6\\}\\), and since \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), I can compute the probability of \\(E_&gt;\\) as \\[\n\\Pr(E_&gt;) = \\frac{|E_&gt;|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{|\\{5, 6\\}|}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSince the possible outcomes less than or equal to 4 are 1, 2, 3, and 4, my event \\(E_\\leq = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\), so I can compute the probability of \\(E_\\leq\\) as \\[\n\\Pr(E_\\leq) = \\frac{|E_\\leq|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{|\\{1, 2, 3, 4|}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAnd now I can use R with these probabilities I computed in my head to derive the probabilities of them occurring in a particular sequence:\n\n\n# Encode probabilities of my two events\np_greater &lt;- 1/3\np_less_or_equal &lt;- 2/3\n# Use them to compute the probabilities of sequences\np_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\np_sequence\n\n[1] 0.07407407\n\n\nThis approach may seem boring at first, since again we could have done this just on a calculator, but it becomes interesting when we ask you to vary the numbers to see what happens to the resulting probabilities.\nFor example, if you wrote the above code for some problem, then in the next problem we could say “It turns out the person providing you with the dice was cheating! They rigged it so that there’s actually a 99% chance of getting a number greater than 4! Go back and compute the probability of this sequence but using the rigged die”\nAnd then you could just change the first line of your code, and re-run the whole thing, to obtain the new probability:\n\np_greater &lt;- 0.99\np_less_or_equal &lt;- 0.01\np_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\np_sequence\n\n[1] 0.009801\n\n\nFinally, we might then ask you something like:\n“Your friend actually invented a machine that can generated any rigged die at all, so that the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 is whatever they want it to be.\nYou are worried because you always play a game with this friend where you win if you roll something greater than 4, then less than or equal to 4, then greater than 4. So you want to see how the friend’s rigging machine could affect your likelihood of winning.\nWrite a function that computes your likelihood of winning (i.e., your likelihood of getting this sequence of three rolls), for any die with any probability of producing an outcome greater than 4.\nIn this case, you could now take your code and transform it into a function, like\n\ncompute_win_prob &lt;- function(p_greater) {\n    p_less_or_equal &lt;- 1 - p_greater\n    p_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\n    return(p_sequence)\n}\n\nAnd then test it on some values:\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.01)\n\n[1] 9.9e-05\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.5)\n\n[1] 0.125\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.99)\n\n[1] 0.009801\n\n\nThen we could ask you to think about\nWhat value for p_greater do you think would maximize your probability of winning?\nand then\nProduce a plot showing your likelihood of winning for 1000 different values of p_greater, evenly spread between 0 and 1\nand you could use the function you wrote like\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\np_greater_vals &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000)\n#p_greater_vals\nwin_prob_vals &lt;- sapply(p_greater_vals, compute_win_prob)\nwin_df &lt;- tibble(p_greater=p_greater_vals, win_prob=win_prob_vals)\nggplot(win_df, aes(x=p_greater, y=win_prob)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  dsan_theme(\"full\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Probability of Winning With Rigged Die\",\n    x = \"Pr(Result &gt; 4)\",\n    y = \"Pr(Win)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, we could ask you to draw a conclusion about this situation:\nLooking at the plot, approximately what value for the rigged die looks like it produces the maximum likelihood of winning? Now write code to compute the actual value, out of the 1000 evenly-spaced values you computed the win probability for, that maximizes your probability of winning. Does it match your guess from earlier?\nFor which you could write code like\n\nmax_prob &lt;- max(win_df$win_prob)\nmax_row &lt;- win_df %&gt;% filter(win_prob == max_prob)\nmax_row\n\n\n\n\n\np_greater\nwin_prob\n\n\n\n\n0.6666667\n0.1481481\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy point in writing all this out is just to say: that was a whole other way to compute probabilities using a computer, where the focus wasn’t on making a big tibble and then extracting smaller chunks out of it and dividing their sizes. We did have to construct a tibble, in order to compute the win probabilities for a spectrum of values, but that was just so we could generate a plot (since ggplot() needed to know specifically what points to put at what coordinates).\nSo, in this approach, we don’t have a single tibble throughout the entire problem that serves as our sample space. We just use tibbles when we need them, as tools for doing math or making plots, while the probabilities themselves are still getting computed using simple multiplication.\nAnd, I mentioned above how the tibble-subsetting method doesn’t allow us to deal with continuous probability distributions. We’ve now seen, on the other hand, how this “fancy calculator” approach is able to deal with such distributions: we were really looking at the distribution of all possible rigged dice, meaning, the space of all dice with \\(\\Pr(\\text{roll greater than 4}) = p\\) for \\(p \\in [0,1]\\). We had to approximate this continuous space using a grid of 1000 samples, which brought us closer to the fancy-spreadsheet approach, but hopefully this can help make it a bit clearer how the fancy-calculator approach can help us when the fancy-spreadsheet approach can’t, even if it (the fancy-calculator approach) requires us to do a lot more math in our heads."

Concretely, to see what’s going on, let’s just look at the row filter we’ve provided (the portion of the full code that is within the square brackets [], before the comma):\n\nsample(nrow(deck_df), 15, replace = TRUE)\n\n [1] 30 32 30 46  7 30 46 27 21 42 25 26 17 35  4\n\n\nWe see that, in fact, we are not really sampling from the data.frame itself, so much as sampling from a list of its indices (from 1 to 52), and then after performing this sample we are going and asking R to give us the rows at the indices that ended up in this sample. Keeping this distinction in mind (between the rows themselves and their indices) can be helpful for debugging code like this."
